      <u who="WHITESCABER"><persName ref="#ttu_457_person_0">Jay Weston David Whitescaber</persName> recording <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_1">Dr. Ron Milam</persName> interviewing <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_2">Leland Komich</persName>. </u>
      <u who="MILAM">My name is <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_3">Dr. Ron Milam</persName> with <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_0">Texas Tech University Vietnam Center</orgName>. <date when="2005-11-10">Today</date> we are talking to <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_4">Lee Komich</persName>. <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_5">Lee</persName>, I’d first like to get an idea on your MOS (Military Occupation Code) and your involvement in <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_7">LZ (Landing Zone) X-Ray</name> and <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_8">LZ Albany</name> effort.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Okay, my MOS, I believe, it was a one 100 B or 671 C, I don’t recall when they changed the MOS structure, but it’s a helicopter pilot and instructor. My role was of course helicopter pilot and I acted as the company instructor pilot. Company standardization officer.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">And that was with the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_1">11th Air Assault</orgName>?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Well, I was with the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_2">11th Air Assault</orgName> for eighteen months and then of course deployed with the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_3">1st Cav</orgName> and finally arrived in <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_2">An Khe</placeName>.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Let’s start with your training. You were a warrant officer?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">I was.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Did you take your helicopter training at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_3">Rucker</placeName>? Or <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_4">Walters</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">I started helicopter training in <date when="1963-06">June of 1963</date>, at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_5">Fort Walters</placeName>. After about five and a half months, we were transferred to <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_6">Fort Rucker</placeName> for completion. At <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_7">Fort Walters</placeName> we flew a two place helicopters called Raven and H23 made by <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_4">Hiller</orgName>. At <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_8">Rucker</placeName> we moved onto the bigger helicopters, I flew H19s and finally an A-model Huey. Upon graduation, headed straight up to the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_5">11th Air Assault</orgName> at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_9">Fort Benning</placeName>.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">When did you arrive at the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_6">11th Air Assault</orgName> at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_10">Benning</placeName>? What month, what year?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH"><date when="1964-02">February of ’64</date>.</u>
      <u who="MILAM"><date when="1964-02">February of ’64</date>. So you were there <date when="1964-02">February of ’64</date> until the deployment in <date when="1965-07">July</date>-<date when="1965-08">August of ’65</date>.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH"><date when="1965-07">July</date>, yeah.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Okay, let’s talk little bit about that time at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_11">Benning</placeName>. I’d like to know a little bit about the training exercises that not only you as a pilot went through, but also in conjunction with the infantry troops.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Well let me start out by saying that it was unquestionably the best training that I received in the twenty-three years that I had in the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_7">army</orgName>. It was the most intense, it was the most difficult, and perhaps the most dangerous. Every effort was made to make it realistic. There were no punches pulled, so to speak. We worked at the edge of the envelope on a regular basis, daily. My gosh, the sling loads that we did, people today would just cringe at, I think. Given the equipment that we’re flying, we were flying the older Hueys with the smaller engines. We were in the field, as an example, we were in the field in <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_12">South Carolina</placeName> and a hurricane came, and I thought, “Wow this is great. We get to go home.” Wrong answer. We learned how to experience a hurricane by burying logs and tying the helicopters down to those logs. I think we dug them in, if memory serves, six feet. You know, the way these stories go over the years it may have been three feet. Every year, you gain a few inches. At any rate, we buried the logs, referred them as “dead men” and tied ropes to the logs, tied the helicopter down, lashed the rotor blades and what have you pretty well. Tied the tents down, and we weathered the hurricane. Came out unscathed I might add. A little wet, a little tired, but other than that, just fine.</u>
      <u who="MILAM"><orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_8">America</orgName> had some experience with putting troops into combat by air, mostly through the advisory efforts with the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_9">ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam)</orgName>. This was really such a new concept though for <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_10">American</orgName> troops. Who developed the training programs that you used in <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_13">Benning</placeName>? I assumed it was you in conjunction with the infantry people. Tell me a little bit about that training process.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Let’s back up just a little bit. Use of helicopters with the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_11">ARVNs</orgName> was nowhere near like what we did. I’m trying to think of an analogy, I can’t do it right at the moment. You know the “It’s not your father’s Oldsmobile” ad or what have you? This wasn’t the air assault as we did with the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_12">ARVNs</orgName>. It was far advanced, far more aggressive, and quite frankly far better implemented because of our training. The division was run by a <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_6">General Harry W. Kinnard</persName>, who was well, just quite a guy. And if you don’t mind a sidebar, something a lot of people don’t know is—if you recall the <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_7">General McAuliffe</persName>’s “Nuts” reply to the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_13">Germans</orgName> at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_14">Bastogne</placeName>? <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_8">General Kinnard</persName> actually coined that phrase or gave him that phrase. So he’s an old solider with a lot of history. One of my favorite people in the world, I just idolize the guy. The <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_14">division</orgName> was run under his firm guidance and the training scenarios and what have you, were developed in his direction. He will humbly say, “Oh, he didn’t do, he didn’t do it, he had other people do it.” But you know what? He’s responsible for it and so I would say he is responsible for all the scenarios. I think everybody within the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_15">division</orgName> contributed mightily. He has recently told me in the last couple of years, that he had the ability to turn down every commander and I guess every solider that was assigned to that <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_16">division</orgName>, so the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_17">division</orgName> was as close to hand-picked as you were going to get. Again, his responsibility and the success, the obvious success, was the outcome of his efforts.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">And the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_18">1st Air Cav</orgName>, the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_19">11th Air Assault</orgName>, that was the first?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Well, there was a <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_20">Howze Board</orgName>, which I don’t know as much as I should. I’m a little embarrassed, I don’t know as much as I should know. They used H-34 helicopters, the old Sikorsky, I'm not sure if you’re familiar with them. Good helicopter for stay, matter of fact, wonderful helicopter given the year they produced them. But nowhere near the Huey. Nowhere near the Huey, it just did not have the capability or the capacity of a UH-1. It was a far, far smaller scale than the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_51">division</orgName>, the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_21">11th Air Assault</orgName>. So we moved from that, I guess the result of that was, actually I was in <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_15">Germany</placeName> waiting to go to flight school and I read an article on the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_22">Stars and Stripes</orgName>, that said the results of the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_23">Howze Board</orgName>, if I remember correctly, its been a lot of years, that the success of the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_24">Howze Board</orgName> was what allowed the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_25">division</orgName>, the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_26">11th Air Assault</orgName> to form.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">I see.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">It was sort of a follow-on, as I understand it. Somebody may come in here and say, “Yeah, he’s crazy.” And that may be, I don’t know.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">So you developed these training exercises, can you tell me a little bit about those, as far that is delivery of troops into combat. Were you looking at it as a—I mean I'm sure things went wrong, you had to develop other ideas, can you kind of explain to me how the program worked as far as using the infantry and getting them into combat.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Before we did an awful lot of with the infantry, although the infantry and aviation training has always been combined to the max, we did an awful lot of flying with empty helicopters, learning to fly the formations. We fly formations at night, my gosh if somebody had told me I was going to do that in-flight school, I would’ve told them they’re crazy. No was in the world can we do this. We flew so close that one of the better ways, one of the ways I used to determine the angle that I was flying on the lead helicopter was to be able to look at their dashboard lights. If you could see their dashboard lights, you were pretty much in the pocket, in position. We did a lot of training with the helicopters because obviously you don’t want load them up with a bunch of people before the pilots had their act together. Then we moved in to training with the infantry and we had a lot of things go right, we had a lot of things go wrong. We tested a lot of equipment that may or may not work, there was a device that could allow you to fly in clouds, if you used it properly. Although I never flew it and I was not involved in the test, what I heard in the club, the device was so big once you put it in the helicopter, you couldn’t carry anybody so what was the point? Number two, its value was questionable. The range of the Huey, well let’s say you get up in the clouds, what are you going to do? Where are you going to go? We had no way of letdown. We did an experiment with a method to move troops in bad weather, it was called “Project Red Dog”. I remember well because it was my first experience with instrument flying and essentially the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_27">army</orgName> put up a low-freq radio beacon and we would sit at the park-your-point loader infantry and a kid would come around with cards and hand you the cards, it was three cards. The cards had the altitude you had to climb to, the first guy went to the lowest altitude, the second guy went a thousand feet above, and the third went a thousand feet above that. (Interviewee silenced his cellphone) You flew to the beacon, and the first person, if I remember correctly, turned forty-five degrees left to start the descent hoping to see the trees before he get in them. The second person, I believe turned right—forty-five degrees right and started the descent and the third person would go straight ahead and ascend. The idea was you can keep pumping aircraft across without using air traffic controls, as the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_28">FAA (Federal Aviation Administration</orgName>) does to control national airports and what have you. I think the project might have worked, the problem was you couldn’t count on the weather on the destination and we had a lot of problems with those radio beacons, they just did not hold up well. So the program was tried and eventually abandoned. We didn’t follow onto it. I must tell you how the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_29">army</orgName> later on adopted what they called a “Tactical Instrument Ticket”, which they issued kids in school. The ticket would not allowed them to fly the federal airways here in the <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_16">United States</placeName>, but it did allow them to do things in combat and in my second tour in Chinooks, they were actually using them in the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_30">1st Cav</orgName> to get into <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_17">Ia Drang valley</placeName>, as an example. Let’s see, there was another device that had a “Rogallo Wing”, it was sort of a platform with a “Rogallo Wing”, it was towed by a helicopter. It had a large explosive, I don’t recall the size, but it was a huge explosive on the cart. The idea was that the Huey would precede an assault and when they get to the area of the assault, he would punch this thing off, it would go down and crash in the trees and blowup, and blow holes for us to land in. Gee whiz, I can think of other things we used, we used some devices to mask our lights, so we can fly in formation at night, and the lights wouldn’t be visible from the ground. We found you’re better off to leave the lights on, dim, or even turned off.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">So you’re doing this all without troops and then there's a point at which you feel comfortable, as a unit, that you can now start training with the infantry. What—I think you said you went there in <date when="1964-02">February of ’64</date> to <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_18">Benning</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Correct.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">You were going to deploy in <date when="1965-07">July of ’65</date>, so that’s eighteen months or so- sixteen months that you are there. Where in there does the infantry start to training with copters?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">You know what doctor, I don’t remember. It was sort of insidious. Suddenly we would carry some troops and we do some things, and more and more and more and we worked our way into it. There was no one day where someone stood up and said, “Okay, today’s the day we’re going to carry the infantry.” That I recall.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Okay, but was it closer to the deployment period? I’m trying to get a handle on how many months of troop training and copters the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_31">1st Cav</orgName> get?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Oh, easily a year.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">A year? Okay, alright that helps me. Was there or is there anything that sticks out in your mind in the training process, that whereas instructors you said, “We got to fix this,” or “We’ve got to improve on this.” Was it pretty smooth all the way to deployment?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">I felt like it went pretty smooth all the way to deployment. I think people—one of the major benefits of this sort of training is you learn your own limitations. I think we had problems with navigation, although our people probably could read maps better than anybody else in the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_32">army</orgName>. I think even that, maps aren’t always that accurate. Partially in places where there’s no relief, no hills, it’s very difficult to get within a hundred meters of the desired spot and that’s critical in combat. Probably, learning our limitations, scaring the heck out of ourselves occasionally, was one of the big advantages to this, you really knew how far you could go before you quit and do something else.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">In your training, at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_19">Fort Benning</placeName>, did you use gunship escorts? Because I’ll tell you where I'm going with this, I know that the Cobra gunship was in development stage at this time and it is not deployed with you, it doesn’t come in until late <date when="1966">’66</date>, I believe. But the Huey is at the B model, was going to be converted or there were gunships—there were Huey gunships.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Correct.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Did you train with gunships at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_20">Benning</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">We did, but not to a large extent. Not to a great extent, that I remember and please remember it’s been forty-one years now.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">I understand.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">But I do not remember doing an awful lot of integrated training with the guns.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">The reason I'm asking you is because there is a point in which somebody realizes that gunship escort is critical to many missions that would follow in the next four or five years of combat and the Huey, as it was armed as a gunship, was not the best that we had, we came up with something better. But I just was wondering if you were involved in any of that thinking at the time, recognition that that escort was going to be important.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Well, as a warrant officer, I was not a decision maker. Let’s be honest about that (Chuckles). However, I watched what was going on and certainly made my voice heard when I thought of something, they may or may not have paid attention to it. It seems to me that the importance of the gunship and the artillery support, was recognized until after we got to <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_21">Vietnam</placeName>. That may not be correct at all. I recognized it in <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_22">Vietnam</placeName>. I felt that we established some pretty darn solid rules about what we needed to make an assault. We recognized that getting outside of artillery range, and not having gunships was really hanging it out. It was not a very smart approach to it. The gunships not only could help us during the assault, but then if the infantry got in trouble. I said the gunships, the gunships and artillery, and those two really worked hand-in-hand. If the infantry got in trouble once the Hueys were out of there, I’m sure every infantry command here would tell you that was just invaluable. I'm positive that they will. Before I left <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_23">Vietnam</placeName>, we got outside to artillery support on one assault. Gee, they got beat up badly. Again, validating the thought that you really need to have that stuff on station.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">So you deployed with the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_33">1st Air Cav assault</orgName> in <date when="1965-07">July of 1965</date>. Copters are loaded onto the carriers, you went over on the ship, is that correct?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Yes, I did.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">You come into <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_24">Vietnam</placeName>, at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_25">Qui Nhon</placeName> I believe, and you’re ultimately taken to <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_26">An Khe</placeName> and that’s your first base?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Yeah, we got off the ships, went ashore and get on a Caribou CV2 and they ferry us to an airfield at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_27">An Khe</placeName>. Some people flew, I was ferried by the Chinook. Some people flew the aircraft over.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Okay. Let’s talk a little bit about the in-country training. How much? How long? How extensive compared to what you already done in <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_28">Benning</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Well, compared to <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_29">Benning</placeName>—let me choose my words carefully because I don’t want to make sound like we were cavalier, and we didn’t need any more training. We did train some, but compared to <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_30">Fort Benning</placeName>, it was nothing. <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_31">Fort Benning</placeName> darn well prepared us. I don’t know that there will ever again be an air mobile division moving into a combat zone as well trained as the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_34">11th Air Assault</orgName>. I don’t know that we can afford it, when I say afford it, <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_35">congress</orgName> would allow the money. So when we got there, we were pretty darn well off.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">So it was a matter of getting used to flying in the jungle, the humidity difference, I suppose?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Well, you know the altitude was a little higher than what we experienced in <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_32">Georgia</placeName> and <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_33">South Carolina</placeName>, but the hot and humid conditions were prevalent, present I should say, in both places. That wasn’t much of a problem. But we did know—we did need to learn our way around geographically. We had problems with maps. For some reason, we didn’t have sufficient maps. So an awful lot of it was done by, you went there once and remember what it looked like.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">About the monsoons, you get there in <date when="1965-07">July</date>, it was a little monsoon season in the <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_34">central highlands</placeName>. Was that a problem?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Well, yeah it was and it would hamper assaults, not only in when you have one planned, you may not have the weather to conduct it, but once you get the guys on the ground, you got to remember that they may need support, they may need supplies, medevac and extraction. If you can’t get the helicopters over there, they’re really not an air mobile outfit any longer.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">While you were at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_35">An Khe</placeName> then and the word comes down that you’re going to have an operation. A very large operation and you moved to <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_36">Pleiku</placeName>, is that right? As a staging area?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Mm-hmm.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">You had about a week there, as I understand, some period of time?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">We had a period of time. I can’t tell you—</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Yes, some period of time. At what point do you realize that this is the real deal? I mean, you’ve been in <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_37">An Khe</placeName> and know there is an enemy out there, and I assume there is mortars and things flying around, but there really hadn’t been any operations as such, as I understand.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Well, we had minor operations. The marines had gotten in trouble over near <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_38">Qui Nhon</placeName>, we had gone over and worked on that. The training at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_39">Fort Benning</placeName> was phenomenal, and I wish that I was sufficiently articulate to tell you how beneficial that was. One of the things that we did at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_40">Benning</placeName>, which at the time I didn’t pay a lot of attention to, so we used a lot of blanks and we would shoot at each other with blanks, and we didn’t have the miles gear, the electronic gear and what have you. It adds a little realism. But you know, when you get into combat, it doesn’t sound any different until you start seeing bullet holes. It had a calming effect I suspect or at least an anti-panic effect. Back to your question, you’re talking about <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_41">LZ X-Ray</placeName> and then <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_42">Albany</placeName> I'm sure.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Yes.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">The deal was, my personal deal was, that I’d been flying every day and I was supposed to have a day off, and they got me in the morning up and said, “Well, why don’t you—”, a fella by the name of <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_9">Dallas Harper</persName>, I don’t know if you got him scheduled or not. We were going to go to <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_43">Pleiku</placeName> for the first time, see the big city. They said, “Well, you need to help out <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_36">A Company</orgName> today.” They kept me for a little while, go down and do some stuff, I don’t think we expected to get into it too deeply. At least I didn’t. When you get done, you come back and get the rest of the day off, and that was fine. So we went down, and the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_37">Reader’s Digest</orgName> version is that it didn’t take very long before I realized that we weren’t going to get to <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_44">Pleiku</placeName> today. This thing was heating up fast and by lunchtime it was—</u>
      <u who="MILAM">So what was your assignment on <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_45">LZ X-Ray</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Well, I think I made nine trips in total. I think that I made five trips, although it was either five trips in or six trips attempted and five trips in. I didn’t say that very well. One trip in, we aborted. We made a big circle, and I can remember vividly seeing an A1E getting shot down as we were making that circle. Which I think was—you asked when reality was set in, I think that was when it set in. It looked like a <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_0">War World II</name> movie, there was flames coming out and the guy was passing, I believe, behind X-Ray from my point. I couldn’t really tell and went into the trees. And I said to the guy with me, I think it was <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_10">Chuck May</persName>, “Geez, did you see that?” And he said, “Yeah.” That was about all the conversation we had, wow. It kind of took my breath away.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">It was shot down by a…? What did you think took it down?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">I don’t know. They had heavy weapons and aircraft weapons in the area, I'm guessing they got hit with one of those, I don’t know. But at any rate, that was when realism really came home. That one instance. We made the circle and aborted the assault. I think <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_11">General Moore</persName>, <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_12">Colonel Moore</persName> at the time, had called it off. So we get back and landed at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_46">Falcon</placeName> and I was told to go back to <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_47">Pleiku</placeName> with <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_13">Dallas Harper</persName>, who was flying on my wing, and get a load of ammunition and we did, we came back. <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_14">Paul Winkel</persName> was the flight leader, and he came over and I said, “Where do you want me to take it?” He said, “Take it to <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_48">X-Ray</placeName>.” I said, “I don’t have a map, where’s <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_49">X-Ray</placeName>?” He—</u>
      <u who="MILAM">So that was your first time at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_50">X-Ray</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">No, no I’d already been in <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_51">X-Ray</placeName>. But I’d been to a lot of LZs that day. One LZ to the next, it didn’t matter what the name was, if I knew it I didn’t pay attention or if I heard it I didn’t pay attention. So he wasn’t sure what to do, and I said, “Either you go get me the map.” He said, “Well, I don’t want to give up my map, so I’ll go with you.” I believe we were the first ones in after the <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_52">LZ</placeName> was closed.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">You were taking in 5.56 mm M16 ammo?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">It was predominantly M16 ammo, I can’t tell you there wasn’t anything else on board.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">So let me understand that day. The first of, I guess <date when="1965-11-14">November 14th</date>, the day that this all begins. What was your first trip it?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">An assault.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">It was? So you had tubes onboard. Was the—were you in the first lift in?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Okay and was it hot immediately?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">No.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Okay, so you received no fire when the first troops were deplaned?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Well, I can’t say that for certain. I do know that <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_15">Roger Bean</persName>, who later I believe returned as Lieutenant General, and I want to say it was the third lift but please don’t hold me to that, but the <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_16">Roger Bean</persName> factor was one that you can certainly talk to others about. <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_17">Roger</persName> took a bullet inside his helmet and I understand that to this day he has a white strip of hair where that bullet passed, between his skull and his helmet. I think that was the first time we realized it was heating up. But a few rounds doesn’t make a battle. You run into a small squad some place or a couple of snipers or something like that, that’s not a battle. So at that point, I don’t think we thought it was a battle.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">But in terms of offloading the troops, they were not getting fired at and your chopper was not getting fired at extensively the first time through.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">The first couple of times, I think.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">So you hadn’t seen anything at that point to indicate what was to come?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">No, I still thought I was going to go to <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_53">Pleiku</placeName> later on that day.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">You still had that idea. At what point do you realize, you said you saw this A1E go down, but at what point do you, as an individual pilot recognize what’s going on and the extent of it?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">About the time we saw the A1E and then we were aborted. Thinking back doctor, I cannot recall ever aborting—well, we hadn’t had that many assaults, but I think we never ever aborted an assault because the <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_54">LZ</placeName> was too hot. So I think at that point, things were getting pretty serious.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">How many trips did you think you made into <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_55">X-Ray</placeName>.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">I think I made a total of about nine.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Nine trips. Those were a combination of resupply and bringing in fresh troops?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">No, as I remember, I did not bring any fresh troops, it was resupply and taking out medevac. I believe it was first trip in but it may have been the second, I carried out, I think it was three POWs. <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_28">Dallas</persName> was carrying medevac and he got shot down on the way out.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">I see. You carried out you said you had three POWs. </u>
      <u who="KOMICH">I think it was three.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Now, tell me how that works? You have POWs on board, you have—were your door gunners responsible for them? How did you—</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Well, you know this was my first—we were playing it by ear at this point. I hadn’t really thought about it. I think you’re going to interview later today, I think I saw his name and in fact I’d like to see him, I haven’t seen him since battle, by the name of <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_18">Rozanski</persName>. He was in the back of the helicopter and took charge of the POWs. There was no communication, I guess it was an intuitive act. It was the obvious thing to do. He took charge of the POWs. The real problem was, when <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_29">Dallas</persName> got shot down, we were well outside the perimeter. Now I was sitting out there with more than what we can carry, and some POWs. What do you do? I can’t tell you how happy I was to see the bushes part and some grunts come out and retrieve the POWs for us and took that burden off our backs. I guess <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_19">General Moore</persName>, someone heard us going down and knew we had them onboard and sent these guys out through no man’s land to retrieve them. Boy, I was happy to see that.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">So you made nine trips into <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_58">X-Ray</placeName>. Several of those trips were medevac, correct?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Four. I believe four were medevac.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Were they described to you as medevac? You knew you were going in to take the wounded out?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Boy, that’s a chicken-egg question that I’d never thought of before. That’s a good question. I felt that my reason for going in was to take the ammunition in. I understood they were getting critically low. <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_20">General Moore</persName> I’m sure can put a sharper point on that comment. Once you’re in there, not taking medevacs out would be criminal.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Did they ask you to—so if you’re coming in, you’ve got a slip full of M16 ammo and grenades and everything else as a resupply, and then were you getting—was <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_21">Colonel Moore</persName> or someone communicating with you to stay on the ground or to hover or to as your being offloaded so we can get these wounded out of there? Or do you see it happening on the ground?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">No, they told us that they had medevacs and if there was any conversation and this is was one of those, at the time it wasn’t significant enough to remember, if there was any conversation, we agreed to take them back out. They may have just said, “We got medevacs,” and we said, “Okay.” We had we had worked with the infantry for that period at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_59">Fort Benning</placeName> and we pretty much knew what they had in mind and what they were going to do. Although, at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_60">Fort Benning</placeName>, we didn’t do that much of medevacs. Some of the commanders simulated having them, but you can’t really simulate having this situation.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Was there any, what I would call formal, not really a good military term, but organized medevac that was just that. Medevac copters with medics on board, flying the red cross, that sort of thing. Was that also you coming in, or were you doing this medevac basically an empty copter with the ammo off and therefore that’s your role in that moment.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Let me qualify my answer, I’m speaking third hand. I didn’t see this, I didn’t hear it, and I can’t tell you what really happened. If you saw the movie, they refused to go in and I’m told that was the case. I think that the movie made a little bit more of a deal of that then they should’ve. I don’t think you should treat your fellow soldiers that way. If they didn’t go in, they had a reason for not going in. They did that best, I'm sure. But I do know that they would not go in or that they were not going in.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">This is the medevacs you’re talking about?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Right. For whatever reason.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">So you guys, as essentially resupplied troop carriers everything else, preform that function.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">When you think about it, it makes an awful lot of sense, we weren’t equipped for medevac, we had no medics onboard, we had no litters, we had no—we had the aircraft first aid kits (Chuckles), for whatever that’s worth. We weren’t really equipped to—on the other hand, we had the helicopters in the <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_61">LZ</placeName>. I don’t think it takes a GED to figure out that if you got a helicopter in the <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_62">LZ</placeName>, let it leave empty and let’s bring another in, yeah that wouldn’t make any sense at all.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Sure. What about the KIAs (Killed in Action)? Were they being put on the choppers at that time or did that come later?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">No, that came later.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">That came later. So your mission, at that moment, was resupply and go out full of the wounded.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">And the POWs I mentioned earlier.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">And POWs. You made about nine trips in, that you recall.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">If memory serves, we’ve done a lot of head scratching and looking at whatever, I made a total of nine trips. Four trips after the <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_63">LZ</placeName> was closed.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">I see.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Four of the nine.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Were you involved in <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_9">Albany</name>?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Yes, I was.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Tell me a little bit about <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_10">Albany</name>.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">I believe I went into <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_66">Albany</placeName> four times. The first two were, I certainly wouldn’t say uneventful, but they were not that far out of ordinary. We were reinforcing and what have you, there was enemy fire there’s no question about it, but it was not that bad. But then I did two at night and I’ll tell you what, somebody has called <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_67">X-Ray</placeName> the hottest LZ in <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_68">Vietnam</placeName>, they weren’t in <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_69">Albany</placeName>. That was just awful. Apparently, there had been some clearing of the <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_70">LZ</placeName>. I don’t know how the <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_71">LZ</placeName> got formed, but the darn stumps were sticking up like this and because we were coming up without lights, we couldn’t see them and I almost—if it wasn’t for <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_22">Richard Smith</persName> the crew chief, I guess this story would have quite a different ending. I almost sat down on top of one right through the fuel tank. <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_23">Smithy</persName> started screaming to pull forward, pull forward. I did and he was one of our older crew chiefs and I knew very well that if he said to pull forward, you better pull forward. We did and we dodged the bullet they say on that one. It looked to me like firefights were going within the <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_72">LZ</placeName>, I mean it was just incredible.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">This was night?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">This was at night. We were brought in by a fellow by the name of <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_24">Spires</persName>, Captain at the time, I think he retired as a Colonel. He crawled out into the middle of the <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_73">LZ</placeName> with a flashlight and that held it up for us. That helped with finding the <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_74">LZ</placeName>, there were traces everywhere. Got us in, bless his heart.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">With a red flashlight?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">No, I think he used a white one.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">He used a white one. So, <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_75">Albany</placeName>. Your mission at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_76">Albany</placeName> was, the same thing? Resupply, medevac?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Resupply, medevac, yeah.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">As you were flying, you’d just made nine trips into <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_77">X-Ray</placeName> and you’re called in to go into <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_78">Albany</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Well, there is a separation of a day or so.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Okay, and you know what had happened at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_79">X-Ray</placeName> at this time? You had a handle on KIAs, on the extent of the battle and everything else with that one-day window. <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_11">Albany</name> is worse in the sense of, if not the duration of the battle, it’s worse in terms of the causalities and the intensity of the fire and everything. How are you feeling about going into <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_81">Albany</placeName> then after seeing what happened at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_82">X-Ray</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">I don’t think my throat has ever been that dry before. I was scared to death. I don’t know how else to say it. They could hear us, I had my lights out and I’m quite sure that when I went into the first time, <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_25">Stinnett</persName> had his lights out as well. He was my—<persName ref="#ttu_457_person_26">Captain Stinnett</persName> who was the flight leader. They could hear us and were shooting in our general direction, there were traces going everywhere. But you know, as <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_38">Americans</orgName> on the ground, these were the guys you had trained with at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_83">Fort Benning</placeName>. I don’t mean to sound dramatic or anything, but these were the guys we had trained with at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_84">Fort Benning</placeName>. I guess if they were not <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_39">Americans</orgName>, I can’t tell you if I would’ve gone in or not.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">The <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_40">PAVN (People’s Army of Vietnam)</orgName> have also had three days of experiences. Firing at helicopters for the first time.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Well, this was a different crowd, as I understand it than the first one.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Different regiment? Yeah, but there’s a learning curve certainly that they would be climbing. You went in at night, you went in on medevac, resupply and you did that four times is that right?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">No, actually twice. Four times total into the <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_85">LZ</placeName>, twice in the really bad periods.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Okay, and it was worse than <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_86">X-Ray</placeName> for you? That was the worst?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Yeah, it was for me. You know, how do you measure such a thing? But it was for me, I thought, “Man, I’d give anything to be back in <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_87">X-Ray</placeName> at this point.” I thought <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_88">X-Ray</placeName> was going to be about as bad as it got.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">After <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_12">LZ X-Ray</name>, after <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_13">Albany</name>, you completed your—you came over in <date when="1965-07">July</date>, so did you go home the following <date when="1965-07">July</date>? You had a year tour?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">No, I got extended.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">In <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_91">Vietnam</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">For how many?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Well it worked out to be close to a month, although we had a new CO (Commander Officer) came in, I think his name was <persName ref="#ttu_457_person_27">Major Brandt</persName>. Super guy, I just really liked him. Once I checked out another instructor pilot, he said, “You’ve had enough, go back to <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_92">An Khe</placeName> and find a ride home.” So I really spent two, two and a half weeks additional in the combat area. The rest was at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_93">An Khe</placeName> and then down at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_94">Saigon</placeName>, trying to get a ride home.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Then you had another tour, I believe.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">I did, yeah. </u>
      <u who="MILAM">So you had a year back in the <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_95">States</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Eighteen months.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Eighteen months and then you went back to <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_96">Vietnam</placeName> on a second tour? How did your second tour compare to your first tour, in terms of combat experiences?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Well, the second tour was in Chinooks.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">You were in Chinooks, CH-47s?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">C-47—CH-47s and they didn’t expose the Chinooks to the same danger, as I saw nothing like <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_97">X-Ray</placeName> and <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_98">Albany</placeName>, nothing, as with the Huey. I'm not sure what your question is, so I’ll ramble and then you can correct me.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">I’m just trying to see if you had—I know that as the entire war, we really never experienced anything like the <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_1">Battle of the Ia Drang Valley</name>.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Which was a good thing</u>
      <u who="MILAM">As in individuals, certain people did experience other kinds of things. Did you, on your second tour, experience anything like you had in that first period?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">No. No. The answer is very simple, I had one really bad experience on my second tour, I got shot down in a Chinook and went down in fire. But it was turned into an extraction. Once you’re on fire, you’re on fire, but I didn’t know that was going to happen. With <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_14">X-Ray</name> and <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_15">Albany</name>, you get to think about it all the way down there. All the way to the LZ. So no, nothing at all like that. I did find that the level of experience and skill on my second tour had dropped unbelievably, I just couldn’t believe it.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">In terms of <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_41">American</orgName> soldiers?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH"><orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_42">American</orgName> pilots. Certainly, no reflection on them, boy they did a wonderful job given the training that they had. But they didn’t spend fourteen months at <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_102">Fort Benning</placeName> prior to going over and it really showed it. Please, in any of this, I'm not criticizing or belittling or degrading any of them. They bellied up to the bar so to speak, rolled their sleeves up. They did a heck of a job. They were going to the <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_103">Ia Drang Valley</placeName>, as I mentioned earlier this tactical instrument ticket. They were taking sling loads into the clouds and flying over the mountains and then dropping down without any nave into this valley, flying the compass and the clock. That’s pretty impressive.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Where were you on your second tour?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH"><orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_43">1st Cav</orgName>.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">You served with <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_44">1st Cav</orgName> also out of <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_104">An Khe</placeName> that time, or had they moved?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">No, they moved up north to <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_105">Camp Evans</placeName>, however mine continued north of <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_106">Evans</placeName> at—Oh, Lordy.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">So you were up in <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_107">Quang Tri</placeName>?</u>

      <u who="KOMICH">And then about <date when="1968-11-28">thanksgiving</date>, the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_45">Cav</orgName> picked up lock, sock, and barrel and moved down near <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_111">Saigon</placeName>.

      <u who="MILAM">What year are we in now? I lost track.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">That would be <date when="1968">’68</date>.</u>

      <u who="KOMICH"><date when="1968-11">November, ’68</date>, we moved down south.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Okay, so we’ve gone through—were you there during <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_2">Tet</name>?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">No, I was on my way over as <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_3">Tet</name> wound down.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">As <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_4">Tet</name> wound down, so you go over in <date when="1969-03">March</date>, <date when="1969-04">April</date>, <date when="1969-05">May</date> period?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH"><date when="1969-06">June</date>.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Okay, <date when="1969-06">June</date>, alright. How about, you mentioned the training that the pilots didn’t seem to be as trained. Did you have any experience at that time with <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_46">American</orgName> infantry troops? How did you see them as being different, compared to the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_47">1st Air Cav</orgName> in <date when="1965">’65</date>?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">I don’t think I can really comment on that doctor because again, we are the grunts of our infantry. Where the infantry really shined was when they were working on the Hueys and that situation. During the first tour, when the LZ was hot, they were getting out of that thing six feet above the ground before you landed. Many times, you might not even hit the ground with your skids, and you were back out of there. I always thought they were doing us a favor. I mentioned it to one of them on time, “I really appreciate that.” He said, “God you guys draw fire, geting out of there.” I'm not too sure about that. I did not have an opportunity to compare the infantry in these situations between tours.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Did you have an opportunity to compare the infantry in Garrison situations, the second time compared to the first? Could you see a difference?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">No, not really. Not really. Again, until things are going on, how do you evaluate?</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Then you spent-—you had two tours in <placeName ref="#ttu_457_place_112">Vietnam</placeName> and then you had a rest of a long career in the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_48">army</orgName>. How long did you stay in?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Twenty-three years.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">And you retired as a CW4 (Chief Warrant Officer)?</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">CW4.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">Well, I have enjoyed this interview. It’s short and it’s too short. I always like to tell people that we have a fulltime program at the <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_49">Vietnam Center</orgName> at <orgName ref="#ttu_457_org_50">Texas Tech University</orgName> where we do oral history, we have over a thousand now.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">Wow.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">We would invite you, if you’re ever out there to come out, or we do telephone interviews also to get everything on record because this is not just the <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_5">Ia Drang Valley</name>, but of anyone that served in <name type="event" ref="#ttu_457_event_6">Vietnam</name>. We really do appreciate you coming into <date when="2005-11-10">today</date> to tell us these experiences.</u>
      <u who="KOMICH">It’s my pleasure and I’m happy to do it. Thank you very much, thank you for the opportunity.</u>
      <u who="MILAM">I appreciate it.</u>
