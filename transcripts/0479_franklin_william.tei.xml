      <u who="NAPOLI">I am Professor <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_0">Philip Napoli</persName> from <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_0">Brooklyn College</orgName>. Today is <date when="2005-11-11">November 11th, 2005</date>. I'm with Mr. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_1">Franklin</persName> in a meeting room in the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_0">Crystal City Hilton Hotel</placeName> and we are going to talk a little bit about the <name type="event" ref="#ttu_479_event_0">Ia Drang Valley Battle</name> and your memories of those days. I’d like you to introduce yourself, if you would.</u>
      <u who="FRANKLIN">I appreciate it. My name is <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_2">Bill Franklin, William W. Franklin</persName>, I go by <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_3">Bill</persName>, I prefer <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_4">Bill</persName>. I was born and raised in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_1">Miami, Florida</placeName>. Had an interest in the military in high school, had a couple of friends ahead of me one year, went to <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_1">West Point</orgName>, one of my classmates. I applied for an appointment, didn’t get it my first year of high school so I went onto <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_2">Florida State University</orgName>. Like many young men at seventeen years of age, I wasn’t sure what I was going to do with my life or what I was going to do with the military especially. I joined the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_3">Air Force ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps)</orgName>. I’d been a pilot, I started flying as a senior in high school, I was already a private pilot. Had an interest in that. That’s how you think when you’re young. The <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_4">Air Force ROTC</orgName>, they raised the age—they actually raised the obligation in <date when="1956">1956</date> time frame from a three-year obligation to a five year obligation for young men, pilots, navigators, and air observers. So I said “Well,” and started looking at the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_5">Army</orgName>. Found out they had a six month and a two year obligation for 2nd lieutenants, so I switched over from <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_6">ROTC</orgName> to the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_7">Army</orgName> at <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_8">Florida State</orgName>. Meantime, my appointment came through to <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_9">West Point</orgName> the next year under <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_5">Danny Fasele</persName>, state representative in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_2">Florida</placeName>. I was about to go up to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_3">West Point</placeName> that summer and I’d been going with a young lady for a couple of years in South <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_4">Florida</placeName>. I loved her, but she didn’t want to wait four years for me to go through school and then get married so I forewent my appointment to <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_10">West Point</orgName> and a friend of mine named <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_6">Lander</persName> took my place and went on up. But after two years, I still wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with my life so after two years of college, I joined the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_11">Army</orgName> on <date when="1959-01-05">5 January 1959</date>, as an enlisted man. Met my lovely wife in <date when="1959">‘59</date> while I was stationed in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_5">Redstone Arsenal</placeName> and we dated for some fourteen months and married in <date when="1960-06">June of ’60</date>, when I was a pay grade of E-4 and I liked the service. I later went to officer candidate school, I was a sergeant E-5, actually post E-6 when I was commissioned after five and a half years of enlisted service. I was commissioned <date when="1964-06">June of ’64</date> as a 2nd lieutenant. I wanted to be an aviator eventually, we had to be in the combat arms. I was trained in guided missiles; I was out in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_6">White Sand Missile Range</placeName> and I remember one officer wanted me to very much so to go to artillery OCS (Officer Candidate School) since the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_12">Army</orgName> had spent so much time training on me on guided missiles. But I at the time fought that because I knew you had to be in the combat arms, infantry armor, artillery, or transportation quarter to be an aviator and that’s what I desired to do at the time. So I became a <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_13">1542 infantry</orgName> unit commander in the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_14">2nd Infantry Division</orgName>, which later became the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_15">1st Cavalry</orgName> division on <date when="1965-07-01">July 1, 1965</date>. I was the third platoon leader in <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_16">Charlie Company of the 1st Battalion 7th Cavalry Regiment</orgName> when we left for <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_7">Vietnam</placeName> on the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_17">General Maurice Rose</orgName>. I believe you already interviewed <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_7">Captain Bob Edwards</persName> later retired <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_8">Colonel Edwards</persName>, who was my company commander at the time. So off to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_8">Vietnam</placeName> we went. Being I was married with two children, I had a son born in <date when="1961">’61</date> out in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_9">Texas</placeName> <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_18">Beaumont Hospital</orgName> and a daughter born in <date when="1963">’63</date> in the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_10">Redstone</placeName> area, <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_11">Huntsville, Alabama</placeName>. Being an enlisted man and older than most lieutenants by two, three, and four years, they kind of looked at me as the old man. I appreciated that, I respected that. I appreciated they were looking to me for advice from time to time. Hope I gave them some good advice. I can remember some things in. Of course, we didn’t have a lot of—we left on the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_19">General Rose</orgName> from <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_12">Charleston, South Carolina</placeName> and spent a month of our initial tour on the ship getting to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_13">Vietnam</placeName>. Being a young man that grew up in South <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_14">Florida</placeName> on the water, I loved the water, I loved to fly, and I’ve never been seasick then or now. One of my vivid recollections is a little sense of humor on the ship, there were three officers, Lieutenant <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_9">Jack Geoghegan, John Lance Geoghegan</persName>, who is a good friend of mine, and <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_10">Neil Kroger</persName>. We occupied one half of the cabin, shared a latrine and on the other side was three lieutenants as well. Each morning of course we got up early in the morning, did our PT (Physical Training) and then we ate at different times. I remember it going over there fed quite well because I was about a hundred and eighty pounds starting out, and I ended up a hundred and ninety pounds in that thirty days by the time we got to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_15">Vietnam</placeName>, even with the PT because they fed us well. One reason—or the sense of humor comes in, they set a basket of fresh rolls, pastries like warm buns and things of that nature on the table, each one—I think there were eight of us sharing that table officers. Six or eight, I don’t recall for sure. At least six, maybe eight. We got in a typhoon around <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_16">Subic Bay</placeName>, I was officer one day of that thirty day ship tour and I go to know a lot those men on the ship and saw how the officers lived. Three to a cabin compared to the enlisted men, more like three hundred to a hole down there, stacked three or four high with their bags and weapons chained to the end of them. So we lived a lot better than they lived at that one point in time, even going over on the ship. Reminding me that I’d made a good decision going to officer candidate school at the time. (Chuckles) I remember we got in this typhoon, which like I said lasted the better part of six days. Each one I’d look around and notice there was less and less young lieutenants and captains and majors in the mess hall or in the dining area, as we called it on this MSTS ship. So I had more and more sweet rolls and rum buns to eat each morning. Finally, it came down to the last day of the typhoon, I was the only one at my table, so I could eat that whole basket of buns! I think that’s part of the reason why I gained that ten pounds on the ship. But I did find myself carrying soup and crackers back down a rolling ship and putting my arms out to catch myself with each wind, to keep from spilling soup. Taking it back to five fellow 2nd lieutenants that were all sick back in the cabin. That was one of the humorous things on the ship going over. One of the less humorous, I got up one morning when it was rolling, getting ready for PT and we had steel lockers and heavy steel drawers. I remember pulling one out to get some boot socks out and as the ship rolled, I hit my right or left ankle, I think it was my right. Pretty bad, it swelled up and I taped it up, still had to take PT. They didn’t give us any slack. I can remember that vividly. Those are the two things on the ship that I remember quite vividly. I had a young man that slipped on a stairwell when we were going through the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_17">Panama Canal</placeName>. He’d injured his neck quite badly, not sure if it was broken or not. So I made a determination that when we were going into <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_18">San Diego</placeName>, on the way over, that we’d take him off the ship. When we got to the pier of <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_19">San Diego</placeName> in the middle of the night, they weren’t allowing anyone to leave the ship except this young man and myself. Went down to get him and he was taken over to a naval hospital ship. So I went onto this naval hospital ship and met the captain. Then, I started having second thoughts about the army, I saw how the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_20">Navy</orgName> lived. This captain had a dining room about the size of this room on the ship with sterling silver and china, and a little Filipino waiter in a white dinner jacket serving him in the middle of the night! I said, “Well, maybe I should’ve considered the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_21">Navy</orgName> or the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_22">Air Force</orgName>!” (Laughs) I had some coffee with this captain and enjoyed his hospitality while my man was getting taken care of. It was daylight then, and when I got back to the ship, lo and behold as often happens in the military, they change their policy from minute to minute to hour to hour sometime. I got back and not only was there me off the ship, there was a couple hundred guys off the ship at least. There must’ve been a hundred phone booths set up on the dock. They had the phone company out and all these guys were making long distance calls. They all asked me before I left the ship, “Will you call my wife? Call my mother, call my girlfriend” I couldn’t do much in the middle of the night, no cell phones back then. I said, “I’ll try to do it if I can” and I couldn’t. I get back and I see all these guys lined up talking to their honeys and their moms and all on the phones. The phone company did a great job setting a bunch of phone booths up. Something else I remember quite well is a young man, just a twelve, fourteen year old at the oldest. Newspaper boy, selling newspapers and the ship—there was probably that much room between the ship and the dock, and the gangplank was up and probably twenty feet to the water. This kid was leaning over to get something, and he fell straight down between the ship and the water. But he came up smiling and they fished him out and got him out. So all these things happened on our way over before we even got there. I knew we were in for a good time. Digression back, I will too say something. I remember when we left <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_20">Charleston</placeName>, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_11">Jack</persName> and I—I would like to even back up a little further than that. If this is going to be recorded for a longtime, the night we left for <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_21">Vietnam</placeName>, if I can digress a moment, jump back about twenty-five days. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_12">Barbara Geoghegan</persName> and my wife <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_13">Sarah Franklin</persName> were good friends. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_14">Jack</persName>, they’d just had their first child and their only child. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_15">Cammie</persName> was born in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_22">Fort Benning</placeName> and actually in a Catholic hospital there, in the early Summer of <date when="1965">’65</date> <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_16">Camille</persName> was born. The night we went out, unlike in the movie We Were Soldiers, the night that we left, we didn’t stand around the jump towers and wait miraculously to get levitated out to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_23">Kelley Hill</placeName>. We actually had carried our weapons in the trunks our cars for several days, unbeknownst to a lot of people and our gear all ready to go. We had to be at our unit at midnight. Matter of fact, we had a lot of replacements come in, some of them from <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_24">Germany</placeName>, hadn’t even been home in a couple of years. To the credit of our commanders like <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_17">Captain Edwards</persName> and others, these men said, “Sir, we haven't talked to our family or seen our family.” He said, “Here’s what’s going to happen. Go to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_25">Atlanta, Georgia</placeName> meet your family there or wherever their coming from or whatever. If you don’t come back, don’t tell them I told you and I never knew you. Go do what you have to do. Go see your family, make sure you are back at a certain day and certain hour.” Late at night, actually midnight, we all showed up at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_26">Kelley Hill</placeName>. We were bussed, some left from various ports of around the country. <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_27">New Orleans</placeName>, some from all the way to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_28">California</placeName>. Some by train, some by <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_29">Savannah</placeName>. We left from <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_30">Charleston</placeName> on the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_23">General Maurice Rose</orgName>. So we bussed to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_31">Charleston, South Carolina</placeName>. When we left, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_18">Jack</persName> and I, my wife <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_19">Sarah</persName> and <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_20">Jack</persName>’s wife <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_21">Barbara</persName> went down to the only all-night diner on <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_32">Victory Drive</placeName> there in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_33">Columbus</placeName>. They drank coffee and cried together because they had a babysitter for <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_22">Cammie</persName> and two young ladies whose husbands were officer’s in candidate school babysat my son <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_23">Mike</persName> and he was four and my daughter <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_24">Kim</persName> was two at the time. So my wife had time to take us out. So that backs up the night we left for <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_34">Vietnam</placeName> in <date when="1965-08">August</date>. Then, the ship and I can really remember it quite well. I have it recorded on an old pencraft pennies reel to reel tape recorder.</u>
      <u who="NAPOLI">That’s great!</u>
      <u who="FRANKLIN">I recorded the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_24">Navy</orgName> band at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_35">Charleston</placeName> playing (Unclear audio) and you could hear the ship horns going off. I still listen to it not too long back. I bought two of them. I left one home for my wife and one for me. That’s actually how we corresponded, by tape. So I actually got to hear my daughter say a few things to me over these little tapes. But the navy band played (Unclear audio) as the ship casts off, you could hear the commands being given by the captain of another officer on the ship, you can hear the horn sounds as we left, etc. Then, I remember quite well of course we’d been having problems with <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_36">Cuba</placeName> for some time as you know. <name type="event" ref="#ttu_479_event_1">Bay of Pigs</name> and thereafter. I remember as we were going close to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_37">Cuba</placeName> early in the morning through the fog of it, they had <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_25">Navy</orgName> ships escorting us and a big frigate came across our—bigger than a destroyer, you know what a frigate looks like, and it was running, looked like flank speed as it went across. Quite impressive to see it coming out of the fog. We saw some light signals going on apparently between it and other <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_26">Navy</orgName> ship. Maybe perhaps between the ship I was on. That was quite impressive. Then, going through the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_38">Panama Canal</placeName>, I’d never been to the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_39">Panama Canal</placeName> before. That was a feat to see coming out. On the Pacific side early in the morning and the sun coming up over by <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_40">Balboa</placeName> and the beautiful Pacific coast and seeing the whales as we went along the coast of <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_41">Mexico</placeName> and later out in the Pacific. Lots of whales. We saw a lot of whales that was quite—I’d never seen that many whales in my life, I remember that quite well. We had another man that was injured. I remember we got to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_42">Hawaii, Honolulu</placeName>. We didn’t go in the harbor, but we anchored outside the harbor and we had a ship come out, the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_27">Coast Guard</orgName> Cutter to take someone off the boat in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_43">Honolulu</placeName>. I remember a <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_25">Major Gill</persName>. I don’t even know—a well-built guy, had a big scar from where he’d been injured before in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_44">Vietnam</placeName>, this was going to be his second tour and he wasn’t—actually with the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_28">1st</orgName> and the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_29">7th</orgName>, he was attached, I'm trying to remember where his position was. I knew him just slightly. But we were all looking on the ship through binoculars at this <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_45">Waikiki Beach</placeName> and <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_26">Captain Edwards</persName> was leaning on the rails, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_27">Captain John Herren</persName> and myself and all of us. We were looking at the beautiful beach and I remember <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_28">Major Gill</persName> saying, “I wonder how many naked women there are in those hotel rooms.” (Laughs) For that he got a good slap on the side of the head from somebody. We hadn’t even gotten halfway to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_46">Vietnam</placeName> yet and already we have these guys thinking about naked women in hotel rooms in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_47">Honolulu</placeName>, but I think they probably think about it all the time, isn’t that right? But that’s something that stayed with me. Like I said, after that, going across the Pacific, getting into a typhoon around <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_48">Subic Bay</placeName>, prior to getting to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_49">Subic Bay, Philippines</placeName> and getting to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_50">Vietnam</placeName>. Then of course, climbing down those ladders into the LST (Landing Ship Tank) type landing craft and going ashore. Then, a big helicopter to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_51">An Khe</placeName>, took to our basecamp, the “Golf course”.</u>
      <u who="NAPOLI">Can I stop you for a second?</u>
      <u who="FRANKLIN">Yes, you may.</u>
      <u who="NAPOLI">Can I ask you your impression of the geography and the terrain that you’re seeing for the first time.</u>
      <u who="FRANKLIN">I had done a little studying about <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_52">Vietnam</placeName>. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_29">Colonel Moore</persName> was also a sticker on the ship when you had that much time going over. There were certain books he would like for his officers to have read. Of course, some of us knowing that’s where we were going to end had done a little geography homework. Then, we read a book going over, we passed around about <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_30">Ho Chi Minh</persName> about the <name type="event" ref="#ttu_479_event_2">defeat at Dien Bien Phu</name> by the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_30">French</orgName> in <date when="1954">’54</date>. We read a book on that, along with several other books we had briefings given by different officers to us in some small group sessions. But when I saw it for the first time, I thought it was quite nice, the shoreline and the mountains in the background over there in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_53">Qui Nhon</placeName>. Later on, I had more of an appreciation for the beauty of the country when I got to see more even then. My first impression was positive as far as appearance of it  goes. But when you get to ashore its typical—I’d been to some other countries in the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_54">Caribbean</placeName>, I had not been in the far east before. I had since gone back to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_55">Vietnam</placeName> and I’ll tell you about that in a little bit for a few minutes. Then, there’s certain smells and sounds that you get around in third world countries that you haven’t experienced before. When you get around people there, they see the sights, the animals, the people. They are certain smells and sounds that come back to even now and later on I got a chance to go down to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_56">Saigon</placeName>, I’ll tell you about that in a moment. We were flown in to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_57">An Khe</placeName>. Of course, we had the green light, the inner perimeter. One impression you get is you see not hundreds, but thousands of Vietnam civilians coming by you every morning as they pass by in line, they were the workers that were working within the basecamp. Then, they all had supervisors that wore a little string around their button hanging down to denote they were a leader of a certain size group. A young 2nd lieutenant would go out as a pay officer and pay them at the end of the day for their work. What was interesting—we knew that of course our base camp was all around this huge mountain we called <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_58">Hong Kong Mountain</placeName>. Stood up right in the middle like a volcano you might say. We didn’t know until later that right within the perimeter of our camp was quite a few <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_31">Vietcong</orgName> living within that mountain and watching us each day because we later on we had a pretty serious fire fight with them. But we had an inner perimeter and an outer perimeter. Of course, these people would work each day clearing off this field of fire for us. But when they’d leave in the evening, which they took a couple of hours to leave just like it took a couple hours to get in the morning, you could take your crew-served weapons and you would reposition your machine guns. For example, you could walk down and get below the terrain and you could walk along and you could see where they’d taken bark. They’d marked trees, they’d taken bark off trees and laid it down to where it would be reflective at night you can—being smaller people for the most part than us, they can either walk almost upright or in a crouched position and they would be below the contour of the terrain. They would be masked from view by the terrain from somebody trying to observe them from up range to down range. But they would have arrows pointed. These notched on trees, they’d take arrows pointed to where your machine guns were. For example, where the platoon leaders CP (Command Post) or his foxhole was. His little command post or foxhole. You can shuffle your men around, move your claymores around. They did this every day. You knew somebody was doing something when they came into your base camp working because you knew that a certain percent of these people were <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_32">Vietcong</orgName> in all probability. So that was something we had with them, even within the inner perimeter. We lived in a jeep—the five officers, it was actually six initially but the fight officers at the time, we lived in a GP (General Purpose) tent, we had it much better than the enlisted men once again because they lived in two prong shelters put together in a form of a tent. If you went off in a patrol and you came back and you had a lot of rain on the side of the hillside where we were, you would find all your gear washed down the hillside into a ravine below and it was sorting it out, cleaning it up and putting the house back in order again. But the officers, we had a general-purpose tent, we stored communication gear, food and ammo. We were able to corner our areas off in a little match and little private area where we had a wooden footlocker and a cot. When you were back in the basecamp, we had like I said, once again the RHIP (Rank Has Its Privilege), you had a little extra facility that the average enlisted men had to live in. We went out fairly constantly on patrols. I can remember—unfortunately we had accidents, incidents. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_31">Jack Geoghegan</persName>’s platoon lost a man in a river crossing, the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_59">Son Ba River</placeName> there. Drowned in a river crossing one night. We had a mortar platoon that fired in avertedly some mortar rounds. The division had built a shower point down in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_60">Son Ba River</placeName>. Once a week we got a shower, we were back in the basecamp. It was kind of a futile effort because by the time you went down the road in a vehicle to the shower point, put your weapon in a weapon rack, take you a good shower, got back in a clean set of fatigues and you were covered with dust by the time you got back to where your particular area in the basecamp was. That was your routine. When you’re out in the field, you can get a—the battalion surgeon, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_32">Dr. Correa</persName> told us that, “Guys, critically places to bathe is under your arms, your crotch and between your toes. If you keep that part of your body clean, you’ll do pretty good!” Of course, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_33">Colonel Moore</persName> was a stickler as was <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_34">Captain Edwards</persName> and I, we all shaved every day. We all had these little boy scout mirrors. The army didn’t have good mirrors so being a good GI, we bought the boy scout reflective mirror, you know. You could bend it; you can put it in a pouch and it would make a survival mirror if you need it. You could bend it back out, if you needed to use it as a reflective device. But you can hang that rascal up and you can shave by it in a helmet. So that’s what we did. We shaved every morning, we washed underarms, crotch, in between the toes. When we got an opportunity, sometimes out in the field we’d get into some streams and  put some guards in each side of the stream, up and down the stream. Like the old <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_61">Texas</placeName> saying, “Make sure you drink up stream of the herd.” We had our pills to put in our canteens to purify our water and we could usually find some water in a field like that and a place to get rinsed off if need be. So we’d squeeze in another bath now and then, when the opportunity presented itself in the right location. But we did go out as companies, the old search and destroy concept back then. A little different now. Take a company of three rifle platoons, put one in one area, one in another, one in another, the company commander back in another location and hopefully which ever one engages the enemy first, the others would be in range to where they could support you or at least be in range of supporting fire by your artillery, mortar artillery. It was a search and destroy mission, trying to find the enemy, flush them out and hope they’d engage you. The critical part—we had a lot of learning curve. I was a fixed wing pilot at the time, but not a helicopter pilot yet. But I knew enough of weight and balance and I was not yet a flight instructor, but later became one. At that time I knew enough of weight and balance that an aircraft could only hold so much. We even had some officers that had to get educated, that they could see an empty hole there in a helicopter and think you could fill it up to where there was no more empty space. They even realized what a hit check was to try to see if it could hover, what the density altitude was, to see if you could lift that kind of load. Even with a rifle squad, when you take at least twenty-one choppers to move Hueys, we had B, C, and D model Hueys back then. Didn’t have the Cobras for gunships then, they came in <date when="1967">’67</date>. We had a modified Huey with M60s and 20 millimeters on it and 2.75 rockets on it that we used for gunships. By the time they’d take the slick, as we called it, and they’d tried to fill up any space on it, these young pilots had to educate these other officers quick like this, “Sir, we can’t carry that, they might put it on one side, and fall out the other side” Whatever it takes guys for us to get off the ground. We always designated a bump man. Unfortunately, it meant disrupting your squad and platoon integrity, but if you had a hundreds helicopters come in and start to move a couple of three, which had been in operation before, we had a hundred on the ground running at one time, moving say three companies of men or more. They’d be more than one of those helicopters that would need to have somebody to get off. So what—you’d have an empty ship or two in the back and a man designated as a bump man and those squad leaders and fire team leaders had a man, each man knew who he was and they would just point to him and he knew to get out of the aircraft to go back of the formation. So you then had a composite squad made up of not necessarily strangers, but guys that didn’t know each other very well. That was a disadvantage of that, but that’s the only choice you had. We also know that when you extract people out of an LZ (Landing Zone) and go to put them in another LZ that there’s this critical element of going back and forth. By the time you put men on the ground, boots on the ground, you go back and get some more replacements, get them back on the ground. That’s when the guys are really hanging out by themselves in a small unit operations, waiting for their own reinforcements to come with the rest of their platoon or company to get in. That’s the way we operated.</u>
      <u who="NAPOLI">But you learned most of this stuff back in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_62">Benning</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="FRANKLIN">At <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_63">Benning</placeName>? Yeah, at airmobile tactics. That’s right, a lot of guys had the advantage of training together for as much as two years. We got a lot of replacements in, right towards the end, and like I was saying, some of them came in, both enlisted men and officers. We had one brigade that needed to be filled up, the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_33">1st Brigade Airborne</orgName> and  we had a lot of officers that were not airborne qualified that needed to go. We brought in guys from the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_34">101st</orgName>, the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_35">82nd</orgName>. We ran a two-week jump school instead of three week to get as many guys airborne qualified as we could to fill up that <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_36">1st Brigade</orgName>. I was at the time a member of the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_37">3rd Brigade</orgName>, which was <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_35">Colonel Brown</persName>, our brigade commander and of course <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_36">Lieutenant Colonel Moore</persName> was our battalion commander of <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_38">1st of the 7th</orgName>. We trained and that was what <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_37">Colonel Moore</persName> was upset about, losing a lot of these men today. There’s one here, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_38">Bill Carson</persName>, a lieutenant. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_39">Tom Mitchell</persName> was going to try to make it this time, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_40">Tom</persName> couldn’t. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_41">Tom</persName> was a <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_39">Georgia Tech</orgName> grad, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_42">Bill Carson</persName> was a <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_40">Clemson</orgName> grad, lot of these guys were on a two-year OBV (Obligated Volunteer) like I initially talked about, rather than a three or five. Their obligation was up early that summer, <date when="1965-06">June</date> and <date when="1965-07">July</date>. So we had a lot of 2nd lieutenants and 1st lieutenants who had fulfilled their two year OBV and had left the service. Of course, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_43">General Moore</persName> and <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_44">General Kinnard</persName>, a lot of people preferred that they extend that. I can remember as enlisted man back in <date when="1962">’62</date>, late <date when="1961">’61</date>, early <date when="1962">’62</date>, we were having problems with the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_41">Russians</orgName>. We extended the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_42">armed forces</orgName> a blanket six month period, just whatever your obligation was, three years, it was six months. As things cooled down with the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_43">Russians</orgName>, they began these young men out because they weren’t many women then, it was mainly men so they let them out and most of them didn’t stay six, they stayed four, three, two. Nevertheless, when they did that, the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_44">Russians</orgName> got their attentions and were serious about this and they backed off. I think if we had extended the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_45">arms forces</orgName> at the time, call up the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_46">reserves</orgName> or something and made a real—they would have made a real impact on the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_47">North Vietnamese</orgName> and the rest of the world and the American people that we were serious about what we were doing. And to the other GIs that had put all this effort into it and say, “Hey, we’re going to see this thing through, we’re going to get started right.” But they didn’t do that, so there was some criticism that the thing that should’ve happened was that they should’ve extended the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_48">military</orgName> and kept those guys that were trained onboard for a while longer. Some of them wanted to go, they had mixed emotions. If you talked to them, they told me they had mixed emotions about where they stay in, going indefinite, they’d said, “Well, I should reenlist.” They really wanted to stay. They were torn between going back to the civilian or staying in the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_49">military</orgName>. But anyhow, that’s the way we operated. Basically in the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_64">States</placeName>, we trained a lot and we kept training. In <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_65">Vietnam</placeName>, I can remember now—I look at what they got now, I was taken out of patrol one night, to go on a night ambush and we taped our dog tags and now they’ve got these plastic things that go over and rubberize. We did all these things, we’d tape all over everything that would rattle and you walked in front of each man and you jump up and down, make sure he didn’t rattle. Now they got a lot better equipment than we once had then. They’ve got specialized devices that they put their dog togs in and whatever else to keep it from rattling. It would be a snap link, it could be cover with a rubber material. But technology has come a long way, even little simple things like that. <name type="event" ref="#ttu_479_event_3">This war</name> now that we’re in at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_66">Iraq</placeName> is quite a different war. Anyhow, talking about getting up to the <name type="event" ref="#ttu_479_event_4">Ia Drang</name>. I had my twenty-sixth birthday in <date when="1965-10">October of ’65</date>. I remember <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_45">Lieutenant Kroger</persName>’s birthday was close to mine in <date when="1965-10">October</date>, he was younger than I by a couple of years. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_46">Lieutenant Geoghegan</persName>’s birthday was in <date when="1965-11">November</date>, not even a week before we went into <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_67">LZ X-Ray</placeName>. The <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_68">Plei Me Special Forces camp</placeName> had been under siege for several weeks. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_47">Captain Moore</persName> had an A Team there. I later was in <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_50">special forces</orgName> A team myself. At this time I was assigned—my platoon was assigned to the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_69">Plei Me Special Forces camp</placeName>. I was actually in the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_70">camp</placeName> and at the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_71">camp</placeName> on the <date when="1965-11-13">13th of November of ’65</date> and word was sent to me to gather in the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_72">camp</placeName> and come to a rally point, which I did and that’s the first time I did not see <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_48">Lieutenant Geoghegan</persName> or <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_49">Lieutenant Kroger</persName> in several days because their platoons were in different areas. We were all put back together. We were given a frag order, a rather abbreviated fragmentary order as to what was going to take place the next day, which would’ve been <date when="1965-11-14">Sunday the 14th</date>. I remember <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_50">Jack</persName> and I celebrated his birthday with Kool-Aid, which my wife had sent in the boonies there. His wife <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_51">Barbara</persName> had bought me a lightweight green ski jacket that she had sent me but I never got! It never got to me, somebody else was wearing it. But <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_52">Barbara</persName> was kind enough to buy it, it was very lightweight with a hood, the jacket had one. I had admired it and <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_53">Jack</persName> told <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_54">Barbara</persName>, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_55">Barbara</persName> bought me one and put it in the mail. Anyhow, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_56">Jack</persName> and I celebrated his birthday with some Kool-Aid in the boonies that night. We all got together then, spread out with our platoons after we got together. Then Sunday morning, the <date when="1965-11-14">14th</date> is of course when we began our air assault into <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_73">LZ X-Ray</placeName>. I had—it was my RTOs (Radio Telephone Operator), who I think a lot of then and still do now, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_57">Charles Dashner</persName>. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_58">Charlie</persName> is here today with his wife and one of his daughters and couple of grandsons. But <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_59">Charlie</persName>’s 21st birthday was <date when="1965-11-14">November the 14th</date>. After we Air Assaulted into <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_74">X-Ray</placeName> and made our way—my platoon and my company, <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_51">Charlie Company</orgName> was given the direction to secure facing the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_75">Chu Pong Mountain</placeName> to the west. The aircraft came in traditionally and landed there from south to north in the LZ they had. The Montagnards that lived in the area, the mountain folks there. The “Moi”, as the Vietnamese call them rather insultingly, or savages. Moi or savage. But the Montagnard are fine people and I had the privilege of being in one of their Montagnard villages with <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_60">Joe Galloway</persName> and my company. Spent a night in one, one time. But they’d cleared off an area there for us later on, we’ll get that in a moment. But this time this was a hot LZ and we came into it, we moved into the tall elephant grass toward the west, toward the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_76">Chu Pong</placeName> and then of course immediately we were engaged. I remember being behind a tree with RTO, on a very short lease as they all are next to me and we were getting quite a sniper fire from trees out front. I used a lot of M72 and was able to take a couple out of the top of a large tree. About that time, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_61">Charlie Dashner</persName> got shot through the chest on his 21st birthday. The exit wound came out below the radio and it was quite large. I remember a lot of his inners were coming out of that hole and I got big hands so I able to push it back in the hole, put my hand over his back and get a medic over to take care of him. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_62">Charlie</persName> was medevac’d out and went to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_77">Walter Reed</placeName>, eventually in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_78">Washington</placeName> where I later joined him for a few months but <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_63">Charles Dasher</persName> was his name, fine young man. I was given another radio operator, I’m ashamed to say I can’t remember his name, I think it was <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_64">Testa</persName>. There was a <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_65">Testa</persName> that was assigned to my platoon the last minute and he was KIA (Killed In Action) on the the <date when="1965-11-15">15th</date>, I’ll tell you more about that in a moment.  We’ll get to that in a moment, but we fought the afternoon on the <date when="1965-11-14">14th</date> and night of the <date when="1965-11-14">14th</date>, it quieted down, sporadically during the night, there was fire. We tried to keep our movement to a minimum, did some checking on the troops. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_66">Sergeant Charles Freeman</persName> was my platoon sergeant and quite a guy. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_67">Charles</persName> was a big heavy set man, big tattoos on his arms back when they were popular to have. Liked him bit a little bit, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_68">Charles</persName> is buried in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_79">Jacksonville, Florida</placeName>. He died a few years ago. But <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_69">Sergeant Freeman</persName>, I will never forget when I became a platoon leader he said, “Sir, you command a platoon, I'm going to run the platoon.” I said, “That’s okay with me, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_70">Sergeant Freeman</persName>, as long you run it the way it’s supposed to be run, I have no problem with that.” He was a good platoon sergeant. Being a former enlisted man and had a little more wisdom than others, I had the wisdom of letting him run the platoon because he did a great job. But he was a big man. I can remember on patrol before he got into <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_80">X-Ray</placeName>, humping through the boonies and I was back down to a hundred and eighty and then about a hundred and seventy-five pounds then, just lean and pretty good shape. He’d be in the back and I’d be in the front. He tried to get me to slow down, I kid him about not being able to keep up. But he did a good job for a big man as he was. He was quite large around the waist line, he could have been a great Santa Claus. But the man did a great job at his age, looking back hindsight it’s always twenty-twenty, I wished I had cut him some more slack sometimes, but he was able to keep up. But <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_71">Sergeant Freeman</persName> did a great job in the <name type="event" ref="#ttu_479_event_5">Ia Drang</name> and keeping these guys alive. On the morning of the <date when="1965-11-15">15th</date>, like I said we got probed fairly often on the night of the <date when="1965-11-14">14th</date>, but the morning of the <date when="1965-11-15">15th</date>, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_72">Colonel Moore</persName> didn’t even know I went out until I sat it in a hotel room with him in <date when="1997">1997</date>, in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_81">San Francisco</placeName> and told him. They called and asked us to sweep early in the morning. They asked each platoon leader what happened the night before, to bring you up to date. We had the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_52">2nd Platoon</orgName>, <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_53">1st Platoon</orgName>, and <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_54">3rd Platoon</orgName>, we were on line and facing <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_82">Chu Pong</placeName>. After hours, the movie depicts somebody bringing them in, but actually I’m the one that brought them in. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_73">Jim Lane</persName> from <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_55">B Company</orgName>, <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_56">2nd of the 7th Cav</orgName> was brought in after dark as reinforcements. So <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_74">Captain Edwards</persName> sent me back to the battalion CP with <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_75">Colonel Moore</persName>, person to get me, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_76">Lieutenant Lane</persName>, and his platoon and I led them in between myself and <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_77">Joe Marm</persName>. The dry creek bed was on my right, and <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_78">Joe</persName> had already been wounded on Saturday—Sunday the <date when="1965-11-14">14th</date> and I didn’t know that at the time because again, you worry about what’s going on fifteen, twenty meters to your left and right. You’re in tall elephant grass and you’re in woods. You got ant hills all around you and enemy around you, so you don’t know what’s going on around much further than your left and right and what you find out and hear on your radio. Some word of mouth gets to you by snail mail, some guy crawling up and telling you what’s happening. I put <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_79">Lieutenant Lane</persName> between myself, on my right flank which enabled us to—we had men spread out fifteen, twenty meters trying to cover that area in tall elephant grass. But we were grateful when <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_80">Jim Lane</persName> came in that night. So I put <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_81">Jim</persName> between me and <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_82">Joe Marm</persName>’s platoon on his right flank. So we had four platoons on line on the night of the <date when="1965-11-14">14th</date> and the morning of the <date when="1965-11-15">15th</date>. The word came for us to sweep out in front of our position. So each one of us platoon leaders took a squad and we went in an echelon right. Of course, way to my left was <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_83">Lieutenant Kroger</persName>. Then <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_84">Lieutenant Geoghegan</persName>, myself and <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_85">Lieutenant Lane</persName>. So we were actually in a echelon right formation, sweeping out through the trees trying to get any guys in, snipers out, and any guys that might’ve infiltrated early in the morning. All of the sudden, all heck broke loose to my left front and that’s when they started their attack. They just popped out of the elephant grass and they were in full <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_57">North Vietnamese</orgName> uniforms, well camouflaged, and running towards us with AK-47. I lost one man on the way back as we were ordered to throw smoke to mark our line. I threw a purple smoke and began to fight our way back to our line, I lost one man in that fight back. Each one of us got back to our platoons, the platoon leaders did intact. Of course, that was the beginning of the initial assault on the morning of the <date when="1965-11-15">15th</date>. But I can still see these guys because you can hit them with a M16— we’d just gotten our M16, we had M14, we’d only gotten our M16 a few weeks before we left for <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_83">Vietnam</placeName>. We’d gone to the range and qualify our weapons. The M16 gave us some problems and issues. Extracting, jamming. The old .45 I carried was one thing, but the M16 was another. It was a good weapon, lightweight, but still had some improvements to be made and made multiple improvements on it over the next few years. The time you could hit these guys with these things and they just keep coming. We found out later on that some of them were on dope. You know, they had pouches and they’d gotten all doped up. I'm sure that’s what kept some of them going. But you know that you hit them because you’d see a big piece of their uniform and body fly before they would go down. But <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_86">Captain Edwards</persName>, as it got worse in the morning, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_87">Bob Edwards</persName> was to my left. There was a machine gun behind an anthill, it was straight in front of <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_88">Bob</persName>’s prone shelter. We didn’t have time to dig foxholes, we all dug two-man prone shelters. I was back behind one of them, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_89">Sergeant Freeman</persName> was to my right. I was to my left closer toward the company commander CP. But at the time I didn’t know <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_90">Lieutenant Geoghegan</persName> had already been killed and <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_91">Lieutenant Kroger</persName> had already been killed. I was a senior lieutenant and at the time I was going to be promoted to 1st before too long. They called for me to come and take the company. I didn’t realize how bad <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_92">Captain Edwards</persName> had been shot. I was moving, I took a <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_93">Sergeant Jeremiah Jivens</persName> was with me, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_94">Jerry Jivens</persName> we called him. Big, burly, Black NCO (Non-Commissioned Officer) that if you ever saw <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_95">Sonny Liston</persName>, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_96">Sergeant Jivens</persName> little friendlier face but was built like him. He was just a real big solid built strong Black man, who had been in the <name type="event" ref="#ttu_479_event_6">Korea War</name>. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_97">Jerry</persName> had been frostbitten really bad during <name type="event" ref="#ttu_479_event_7">Korea</name> on his feet. I remember a couple of times—reason why in the movie, We Were Soldiers comes back to show <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_98">Jack Geoghegan</persName> checking the young man’s feet. I remember checking <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_99">Jerry</persName>’s feet at a time or two because I didn’t realize how bad they were and he had his socks off one day and between his toes was all rotten looking because he had gotten—we had these old corporate type military jump boots or old black combat boots. We didn’t even have the jungle boots at the time. They just got a brand new pair and in six weeks they get in bad shape. Reason why I was a little angry about that, I was sent earlier in the operation before <name type="event" ref="#ttu_479_event_8">Ia Drang</name>, I was sent to spend one week with the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_58">101st Airborne Division</orgName> and <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_100">Lieutenant Kroger</persName> spent a week with the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_59">173rd Airborne Brigade</orgName> and we were doing some cross training with each other. I was out on patrol with <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_101">Lieutenant Ken Eklund</persName>, a <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_60">West Point</orgName> graduate from the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_61">101st</orgName>, we’d been out all night, got back in early morning on my 5th day and I got word to terminate my attachment early and get back to the base camp at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_84">An Khe</placeName>. What happened when I got back—the first soldier I had killed in my platoon was a specialist <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_102">Romanco</persName> from <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_85">Pennsylvania</placeName>. It was friendly fire, something like the <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_103">Tilman</persName> situation. I got back and found out that during the night, the way our foxholes were traced along the green line there at the base camp, the Golf Course, some were down in front, some were back, some were down front. It was foggy and what I found out in an investigation when I got back, that one of our—<persName ref="#ttu_479_person_104">Sergeant Calloway</persName>, who happened to be a fine, young, black, NCO buck sergeant, who had another gentleman with him, one of our E4s I believe—and then <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_105">Romanco</persName> who was also E4, they were reliving in place. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_106">Sergeant Calloway</persName> was reliving in place, one man to each foxhole. They were coming through the fog, they were out in front of the perimeter. They’d left one gentleman by himself in the foxhole. They were approaching, and the gentleman in the foxhole they were approaching, opened up on them and it killed <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_107">Specialist Romanco</persName>. I believe that story, I returned to camp, of course they didn’t find any fault with me, of course they talked to all the men, they found out they had all been trained properly. We had a procedure that they were supposed to follow, and the procedure wasn’t followed like it should’ve been. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_108">Sergeant Freeman</persName> was not in any trouble because of it or any of the NCOs or anything. But there was an unfortunate thing to happened. The young man was transferred for his benefit to an assault helicopter squadron and became a door gunner on a helicopter at his request. I say that to say this, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_109">Sergeant Calloway</persName>, the NCO I described, myself, my first trip to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_86">Saigon</placeName>, back then, we were all operating under <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_62">MACV</orgName> circular number 1, which was fine when you had one advisor killed every few weeks, months, or a year. But what that required was that they had a funeral at their chapter number 1 at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_87">Tan Son Nhut</placeName>. The <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_63">Vietnamese army</orgName> would present some medals to him, drape a flag on a coffin, have a funeral there and then send his body back home. That was fine when you were losing one now and then as an advisor but all of the sudden in that—later on that came back to bite us because when you lose 225 to 300 men in a couple of weeks’ time, still that circle had to be found and be rescinded. But at the time it took me, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_110">Sergeant Calloway</persName> and five enlisted men out of the field. We had to bum a ride from <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_88">An Khe</placeName> to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_89">Qui Nhon</placeName>, to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_90">Tan Son Nhut</placeName>. Got in there late at night, had to go—first of all had to go to a morgue, which was a little air conditioned office and then went into a room that was not airconditioned. Nineteen <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_64">marines</orgName> had been killed in an ambush, their bodies laying all over the floor with tags on their toes. Then, back in the refrigerator that was air conditioned, to identify <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_111">Romanco</persName>’s body. The guys hadn’t eaten all day, late at night and then after I took <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_112">Sergeant Calloway</persName> with me, we did that. Took the rest of the guys down, trying to find a chow hall about 22:00 hours at night, find something to eat. Finally we found a mess sergeant and let us sit in the back. We got some milk and a baloney sandwich and that sort of thing, it carried us over to the next day. It took us out of the field and that day—the next day we all had to bring khaki uniforms out of the bottom of duffle bags and tried to get them looking good. Mooch piles and ration piles we go down there. We go to the funeral there at chapel number one. We give him a sendoff. I’ll never forget seeing his big long tin sheds just coffin after coffin, lined up under these tin sheds there waiting to be used, these were empty coffins. This was in <date when="1965">’65</date>. So we got him taken care of there and then we had to hitch a ride back, and I’m on a C123 coming down. Going back I went on a Caribou, coming down I was on a C123 with <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_65">Air Force</orgName> crew and I happened to know the co-pilot, a friend of mine, it’s a small world. Anyhow, they had a bunch of fruit in the back and we broke into the crates and did get some fruit. I left that part out, but we did have some fruit on the way down to start with and then we got the sandwich later that night. On the way back we went on Caribou number 1, the first army Caribou that was assigned to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_91">Vietnam</placeName>. We flew back to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_92">Tan Son Nhut</placeName> and then from <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_93">Tan Son Nhut</placeName> back to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_94">Qui Nhon</placeName>. While I was at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_95">Qui Nhon</placeName> I was standing on the airfield there, I’m talking to neat looking little trim guy, about 5’6, major in an A1E Skyraider. He’s standing there talking to me, fifty-two years old, was back on flying status. The <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_66">Air Force</orgName> put everybody flying behind a desk at about forty-two years old back then, but when the <name type="event" ref="#ttu_479_event_9">Vietnam War</name> started getting cranked up they let the guys that could pass a flight physical and wanted to fly back on flying status, and he was fifty-two years old and flying an A1E Skyraider. Later on these Skyraiders had a big impact in helping us in the <name type="event" ref="#ttu_479_event_10">Ia Drang Valley</name>. I was impressed with him and his physique and how excited he was about being back in the cockpit again, being a pilot myself. So I finally got my guys back to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_96">Qui Nhon</placeName>, from <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_97">Qui Nhon</placeName> to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_98">An Khe</placeName>, <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_99">An Tuc</placeName> to the base camp. Then, coming back to that, I’d mentioned <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_113">Romanco</persName> was the first one we had killed. Then, the morning of the <date when="1965-11-15">15th</date>, when they called me to come and take over the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_67">company</orgName>, I was moving from my right to left and this dead blade machine gun. I was crouched low and moved as best as I could, my knees and hands. Machine gun opened up on us, killed this young man radio operator. Hit the first two rounds—the first two I got hit with, it hit me on my right side, killed <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_114">Sergeant Jivens</persName>. Hit <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_115">Sergeant Jivens</persName> in the chest, but when <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_116">Jivens</persName> went down, I’ll never forget—see, I was born in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_100">Lima, Florida</placeName>. I grew up in a segregated time and never went to school with any black kids, high school or college. My first experience with good black friends was in the service, but I remember <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_117">Sergeant Jivens</persName> asked me months back, “Sir, are you prejudiced?” And I said—we had dust all over us one time, kind of white chalky dust. I looked at him and said, “<persName ref="#ttu_479_person_118">Jerry</persName>, you look like a white man to me anyhow. So why would I be prejudiced?” We joked and I’ll never forget he was down in the grass and he started calling for me and then, he stopped calling. But <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_119">Sergeant Jivens</persName> was killed and this other gentleman, I believe his name was <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_120">Testa</persName>, I can’t swear to that, the radio operator. I was in pretty bad shape, but I was able to get on the radio and I was almost to <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_121">Captain Edwards</persName> positions and I don’t even remember who took out the machine gun behind the hill, it wasn’t me. We were still just trying to stay alive, fighting a little bit. I was on the radio talking and on my left side a sniper hit me from a tree up above, right through the center of my abdomen. That was the second time I got shot—the third one. After that I wasn’t worth much. (Chuckles) I do remember some of my guys driving me on a poncho liner across—I do remember looking back one time before I was out of it, seeing about twenty <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_68">North Vietnamese</orgName> soldiers running between me and towards the termite hill where the battalion CP was. Had to be careful shooting in the backs of them and that’s probably what you see in the film, a lot of these rounds coming into the battalion CP, some of them could’ve been friendly rounds for all I know. I remember being dragged on a poncho liner across the LZ, bouncing my bottom off the ground there, bouncing the corners of it. After I got in the LZ, I was triaged—I didn’t know this, but <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_122">Sergeant Keaton</persName> was a senior medic and doctor battalion sergeant, said I wouldn’t survive and they put me over behind that ant hill with a bunch of guys in dead body bags and I didn’t know until the book came out in <date when="1992">’92</date> that—even talking with <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_123">Sergeant Keaton</persName> at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_101">Benning</placeName>, I didn’t realize they triaged me as unlikely to survive. I didn’t realize and later on <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_124">Captain Dillon</persName> was the reason I got out, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_125">Matt Dillon</persName>. I’m laying over amongst these body bags—I saw a picture of myself at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_102">Fort Benning</placeName> about <date when="1995">’95</date> or so in black and white, on the ground. I was unconscious at the time and a bunch of guys where dead around me there, some of them already in bags. I was there in that picture. But when I end up being medevac’d out of there, I was thrown in on top of <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_126">Bob Edwards</persName> on the helicopter as they were taking me out to take me back to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_103">LZ Falcon</placeName>. My chaplain, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_127">Neven Schneider</persName>, our battalion chaplain <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_69">1st of the 7th</orgName>, was an airborne chaplain, quite a guy. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_128">Neven</persName> lives about a couple miles from me in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_104">Melbourne, Florida</placeName>. He’s been there since <date when="1993">’93</date>, I’ve been there since <date when="1988">’88</date>. We have breakfast about once a week together on Thursday mornings after our military officer’s association meeting. But <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_129">chaplain Schneider</persName> was back at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_105">LZ Falcon</placeName> and I remember <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_130">Sergeant Gray</persName>, one of my sergeants that was supposed to be on R&amp;R (Rest and Recuperation), he was back at the base camp and lo and behold they had brought him to—they actually brought him to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_106">Camp Holloway</placeName>, I think. Then, I was moved from <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_107">Falcon</placeName> to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_108">Holloway</placeName> and they had a <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_70">Charlie</orgName> med set up at <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_71">Holloway</orgName> and it’s the first time they had ever given four units of whole blood to guys. Some of the guys were given four units of whole blood that—I lost, I was told, eleven pints of blood. I was getting four units of whole blood, one on each leg and one on each arm. Kind of put your body into shock but gets your blood pressure back up. Then, I was medevac’d over to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_109">Qui Nhon</placeName> to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_110">85th Medevac Hospital</placeName>. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_131">General Westmorland</persName>, I remember him coming to see me there and putting a purple heart on me. I remember <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_132">Sergeant Brooks, Al Brooks</persName>, who again, fine NCO company clerk, had a smile wide as can be, all teeth. Put a helmet on and all you would see teeth. All you’d see was a black face and all these white teeth. Reason why I say that, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_133">Sergeant Brooks</persName> came over to see me. He’s the first one that told me about <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_134">Lieutenant Geoghegan</persName> and <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_135">Lieutenant Kroger</persName> being killed, and <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_136">Sergeant Jivens</persName> and some of the other guys. When it came time to medevac me to the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_111">States</placeName>, a C130 came in from <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_112">Clark</placeName> in the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_113">Philippines</placeName> and I was the worst of the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_72">American</orgName> wounded. There was two <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_73">Koreans</orgName> that had been hit by an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade), they were driving a fuel truck for the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_74">20th Division</orgName>, they blew up and they were just burnt from head to toe. So they loaded all the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_75">Americans</orgName> on the aircraft and then they put me on last. In the middle they put these two rocks on each side of them and their arms were just out and they were crisp as we were taxing on that PSB. I couldn’t see how they could survive. They had a full colonel, <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_76">Air Force</orgName> doctor and an <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_77">Air Force</orgName> captain with us in the back of the aircraft. When we got into <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_137">Clark</persName>, I remember being put on an ambulance. I saw the three ambulances and I saw a big bus with a red light on and the walking wounded, got on a bus and the two rocks and myself were each put on an ambulance and taken to the hospital at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_114">Clark</placeName>. Lo and behold I’m put in a room with <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_138">Lieutenant John Hanlon</persName>. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_139">John</persName> was from the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_78">2nd of the 12th</orgName>. He was here at the reunion last year. I went all these years without seeing <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_140">John</persName> from <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_115">Walter Reed</placeName>. I saw him there at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_116">Clark</placeName> and he and I are on the bed. One policy the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_79">military</orgName> had then, that I opposed, as an officer we had to buy our uniforms and do this and that, that’s fine I had no complaints for that, but also we’re supposed to pay for our meals on route. I’m naked now at this time, I had a brace on my knees and a big towel rolled up under my testicles and I’m all black and blue because a grenade had come in as well and right in front of my left eye. I had some burns and I’m in this hospital bed, <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_141">Lieutenant Hanlon</persName>’s paralyzed from the chest down from a round through the chest, he was a platoon leader. We’re both laying up in there and this slick looking <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_80">Air Force</orgName> NCO comes in and I mean all dressed spit shine and Corfam shoes, clipboard and he wanted the meal money, a dollar and fifty-five cents for <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_142">Lieutenant Hanlon</persName> and myself for a meal at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_117">Clark</placeName>, which I don’t even remember eating, much less getting before they could put us on the aircraft to take us to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_118">Tachikawa, Japan</placeName>. Before I could say anything <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_143">Lieutenant Hanlon</persName> said, “You son of a bitch.” And he took a shoe and he threw it at that NCO and he had several stripes down his arm, I don’t remember now, he was probably an E6, an E7. He turned and went out of the room after <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_144">John</persName> threw that shoe at him. We got put on the aircraft and we went to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_119">Tachikawa, Japan</placeName>. There was snow on the ground. I remember they were carrying my litter down and they dropped one corner of it down. I had IV bottles coming out, I had tubes come out of my stomach, my IV bottle. They dropped one corner of my litter on the ground but I was looking at the snow and I remember I didn’t get upset about it. I remember when they put me on the aircraft C141 after staying in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_120">Tachikawa</placeName> a couple of days to come to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_121">California</placeName>. I’ll never forget this <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_81">Air Force</orgName> nurse captain; she had a face that looked like a pizza pie. She had to have had acne so bad when she was young that, bless her heart, she was old enough it looked like to be my mother and still a captain. She was the prettiest thing I saw there for a while. You know, the closest contact I’d had with a female. She pulls the sheet back and like I said I got this brace and this towel rolled up. She said, “What the hell happened to you lieutenant?” And I said, “It’s a long story captain.” She didn’t have time to hear it she just pulled the sheet back up. She just laughed, but she was a good ol’ gal and she helped take care of me across the pond there. Then, the night I got in the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_122">States</placeName>, to show you what a small world it is, I was a—a Baptist chaplain named <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_145">Captain Dale Burton</persName>, was a chaplain at the <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_123">85th Medevac Hospital</placeName> and he’d written my wife a long letter. Of course, my wife knows my sloppy handwriting and <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_146">Chaplain Burton</persName> had a very nice handwriting. He wrote like six, seven pages and then at the end he wrote on there, explaining who he was as a P.S. Well, he put the letter in the mail. My wife the day she gets the letter—I’d gone to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_124">California</placeName> and the guy in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_125">California</placeName> was <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_147">Sergeant John Rangel</persName>, who is here now. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_148">John</persName> was with <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_149">Joe Marm</persName>, he got his Medal of Honor. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_150">John</persName> and I had a room together in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_126">California</placeName> and we told each other goodbye, gave each other a little embrace as we were leaving and I was put on an old C54, then a four engine. Do you guys know what a C54 is? A little four engine prop job that the airlines flew then, DC6s, DC7 type aircraft. I was flown a long day and I ended up in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_127">Scott Air Force base</placeName> in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_128">O’Fallon, Illinois</placeName>. I’m being brought into the room to be cleaned up, a big room in <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_82">Scott</orgName> and a <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_151">Major Larry Hess</persName> comes walking through with his wife. That was <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_152">Lieutenant Larry Hess</persName>’, who was killed in <name type="event" ref="#ttu_479_event_11">Ia Drang</name>, dad who was an <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_83">Air Force</orgName> pilot at <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_153">Scott</persName>. He asked, “Did anybody know <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_154">Lieutenant Larry Hess</persName>?” They’d already gotten word that their son had been killed and—I and a couple others did know <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_155">Larry</persName>. So they came over to speak to me, got my name, phone number and everything, where my wife was living <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_129">Guntersville, Alabama</placeName> with her family home, with my two children. He said, “I’ll call your wife.” And he went home that night and my wife had gotten the letter that day. She was all upset, she’d been on the phone trying to find out where I was. When <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_156">Lieutenant Hess</persName> and <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_157">Mrs. Hess</persName> called to tell her, “We just left your husband at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_130">O’Fallon Air Force Base</placeName>. He’s on his way to <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_158">Walter Reed</persName> tomorrow. That’s where he’ll be and that’s where you can find him.” So she found out, not form the department <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_84">army</orgName> about where I was, but from an <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_85">Air Force</orgName> major who cared enough to check me out and call my wife. So the next day I was put on the same type of C54. Long day, long day. Took off, went all the way to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_131">Kelly Field, Texas</placeName> to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_132">Maxwell Field, Alabama</placeName> to <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_133">Andrews Air Force Base</placeName>. Left when it was dark in the morning, got into <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_159">Andrews</persName> at dark at night, the <date when="1965-11-24">day before Thanksgiving</date>. Got in the hall at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_134">Walter Reed</placeName> and had me in a gurney in the hall that night, because they didn’t have enough room for us. All of us where starting to come in. They put me in a private room, in ward two—ward eleven, 2nd floor. I saw in that room the entire time I was there, from <date when="1965-11">November of ’65</date> to <date when="1966-08-03">August 3rd 1966</date>. Even when they let me out on convalescent leave, they kept my room for me. I had a private room, they treated me good. I was one of the early officers from the <name type="event" ref="#ttu_479_event_12">Vietnam War</name> to spend that much time at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_135">Walter Reed</placeName>. It’s pretty young nurses and I had some of the finest medical care. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_160">Dr. Crayder Van Busker</persName> was a full colonel chief of urology. I had five operations, three where they open me up and two where they go in—(Audio not clear). A young—I had another major that was a doctor but I had a <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_161">lieutenant colonel named Minimeyer</persName>, whose brother had been in the German army during <name type="event" ref="#ttu_479_event_13">World War II</name>. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_162">Colonel Minimeyer</persName>, through the quality of medical care I got, later on became <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_163">Full Colonel Minimeyer</persName> and then <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_164">General Minimeyer</persName>, and forget <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_165">Major General Minimeyer</persName>, they bypassed the two stars and made him surgeon general of the <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_86">army</orgName>. So I knew him as a lieutenant colonel, I knew him as a lieutenant general. I got to see him in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_136">Washington</placeName> a couple of times when I’d come up, but he was that good—that’s the quality of medical care you had back then. That good of a man as well as an army officer and a doctor, he was a great doctor. I remember as he took out some fragments—one bullet, to show you about how things go, I had a bullet taped to my left arm. I was dirty, I had blood on my hands and dirt from <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_137">Vietnam</placeName>. I’d been in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_138">85th</placeName>, been in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_139">Clark</placeName>, been in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_140">Tachikawa, Japan</placeName>, <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_141">California</placeName>, <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_142">Illinois</placeName> and now I’m at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_143">Walter Reed</placeName> and my wife seeing me with the same dirt, the same blood and they didn’t have time to clean you all up. When my brother in-law, sister and my wife walked in to see me at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_144">Walter Reed</placeName> on <date when="1965-11-25">Thanksgiving day 1965</date>, first time I’d seen them in a while. Then, they finally got around to clean this up and getting it off. Well, I had one bullet taped to my arm, after a couple of weeks I was complaining about a pain on my left side, so they took me down to a—at the end of this I had this private room but there was a little surgical room about half the size of this one, and they’d x-rayed me first and they’d said, “You’ve got something that is working its way out.” They just made a little local layer on my left and just popped it out. So I got another bullet which they gave me as a souvenir. Later on in surgery, after one of the surgeries they gave me one and some fragments, which I have in a jar. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_166">Colonel Minimeyer</persName>, little brown medical bottle that he wrote on some tape “VC stuff”, you know. He put the—not scotch tape, the white adhesive. It’s still on the bottle, sits on a little bookcase at home and I’ve still got the prescription note he’s written something on, it was an old <orgName ref="#ttu_479_org_87">army</orgName> prescription pad, then the fragments and the bullet that he put in the jar for me. I still have that as a souvenir as well. Went back to <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_167">Sergeant Jivens</persName> when he was killed. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_168">Sergeant Jivens</persName> married his high school sweetheart, had like six or seven children, I don’t remember exactly, maybe eight but I know it was at least six. In <date when="1993">1993</date> was the first reunion my wife and I ever made. When they were writing the book We Were Soldiers, they didn’t know where I was, they thought I was living in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_145">Florida</placeName>, but I was actually flying out of <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_146">Alabama</placeName>, living in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_147">Huntsville, Alabama</placeName> for sixteen years. I was a commercial pilot. <persName ref="#ttu_479_person_169">Betty Jivens Mapson</persName> was her name, a little petite young lady, who wasn’t so young she was in her 40’s, she had a master’s degree. Had a daughter with a master’s degree in <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_148">Washington</placeName>. Shows up at our banquet here, sits at a table with me and told me who she was. She really wrote a nice—almost a full page on the fly of my book about glad she was to meet me and actually talk to someone that had been with her father when he died. She said she was so young she wished she and her brother could talk to me and learn about her dad. I got the chance to see her and her brother a time or two down at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_149">Fort Benning</placeName> on <date when="2002-02-13">February the 13th of ’02</date>, when we premiered the movie there at <placeName ref="#ttu_479_place_150">Fort Benning</placeName>.
