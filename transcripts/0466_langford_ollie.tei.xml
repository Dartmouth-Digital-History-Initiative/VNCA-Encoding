      <u who="LANGFORD">Came about going to the military academy at <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_0">West Point</placeName> because I grew up on a farm and wanted an education. I could not afford the education, but one year at the <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_0">University of South Carolina</orgName>, <persName ref="#ttu_466_person_0">Strom Thurmond</persName> gave me one of his first appointments when he was elected on a right-end ballot for the <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_1">senate</orgName>. I was able to get my education by going to <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_1">West Point</placeName>. I graduated in the class of <date when="1959">1959</date>. Then I was educated through the army schools and eventually went to <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_2">Hawaii</placeName> for my first assignment, for three years. Had two children in <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_3">Hawaii</placeName>. Came back to the school of <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_4">Fort Sill</placeName>, for advanced artillery course and was assigned to <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_5">Fort Benning</placeName> to the <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_2">2nd Infantry Division</orgName>. That particular brigade of the <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_3">2nd Infantry Division</orgName> was put into the <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_4">11th Air Assault</orgName> for the air assault test. So we spent our time training. When I reported into that unit, which was the <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_5">5th of 38th Artillery</orgName>, I was made battery commander of <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_6">B Battery of 5th of the 38th artillery</orgName>. We trained from <date when="1964">1964</date> until <date when="1965">1965</date>. In <date when="1965">1965</date>, after the air assault and the tests and so forth, I’d had my battery three months longer than what I’m supposed to have it and I gave it up to a <persName ref="#ttu_466_person_1">Captain Bob Barker</persName>, who later became <persName ref="#ttu_466_person_2">Colonel Barker</persName> and he commanded <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_7">C Battery of the 1st of the 21st artillery</orgName>, which we changed our name when we became <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_8">1st Cav</orgName> from <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_9">5th of 38th</orgName> to the <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_10">1st of the 21st artillery</orgName>. <persName ref="#ttu_466_person_3">Colonel Barker</persName> became the <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_11">C Battery</orgName> commander. I became the fire direction officer of the battalion, the assistant S3 is also the fire direction officer. All artillery fires are controlled through a battalion fire direction center and each battery has a fire direction center and we coordinate through each other down to the forward observers and the liaison officers for the distributions of fires.</u>
      <u who="NAPOLI">Tell me a little bit about how then the unit—tell me about the trip to <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_6">Vietnam</placeName>. You went—did you go on board boat?</u>
      <u who="LANGFORD">Let me take you back to when we were training in the—something that really had an impact on our unit was we trained for a year in the air assault concept. All of our lieutenants were experts. I had five very good lieutenants. Three were so excellent that they were quality of general officers. They trained all through air assault and then when we changed our name to <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_12">1st Cav Division</orgName> and was ordered to by <persName ref="#ttu_466_person_4">President Johnson</persName> to <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_7">Vietnam</placeName>, <persName ref="#ttu_466_person_5">Secretary of Defense McNamara</persName> made a decision not to hold <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_13">ROTC ( Reserve Officer Training Course)</orgName> people, officers and so forth that was on two year tours, not to hold them in the service. Consequently, we were gutted of our well-trained lieutenants and had a lot of other lieutenants come into the units which they were good officers and many of them did well but they had missed that year of training of air assaults. That had a huge impact of a lot of our operations until we were in country long enough to get through that portion of it. We were ordered in <date when="1965-08">August of 1965</date> to go to <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_8">Vietnam</placeName>, we loaded on buses at <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_9">Fort Benning, Georgia</placeName>, what is called <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_10">Kelly Hill</placeName> which still exists at <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_11">Fort Benning</placeName> and we went by bus to <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_12">Charleston, South Carolina</placeName>. Once we got to <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_13">Charleston, South Carolina</placeName>, we loaded on a troop transport ship called the <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_14">U.S.S. Rose</orgName>. There was a song about the time, about the rambling rose. We had a lot of singing and so forth. We went down, went through the <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_14">Panama Canal</placeName>, then we were taken up to <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_15">Long Beach, California</placeName>. They said to bring water and take-home fuel and so forth. But we also found out that we were taken to <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_16">Long Beach, California</placeName>, because the <name type="event" ref="#ttu_466_event_0">Watts riots</name> were going on and they had to decide, whether to unload us there for combat or whether to go on to <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_17">Vietnam</placeName>. We sat in <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_18">Long Beach</placeName> for, I think two days, waiting to see whether we were going to have to unload and take action there or go on over. We finally pulled out of <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_19">Long Beach</placeName> on a thirty day cruise basically—well, twenty day cruise then. We had to stop off of <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_20">Pearl Harbor</placeName>, off of <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_21">Hawaii</placeName>, to have one of our soldiers lifted off the ship and take to shore for appendicitis operation. We arrived in <date when="1965-09">early September</date> at <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_22">Qui Nhon, Vietnam</placeName>. We sat aboard ship the first night watching fires—people firing weapons on shore. Next day, we got onto landing crafts and went onto the beach. As we went onto the beach, they had Chinook helicopters there and we were air lifted in to <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_23">An Khe</placeName>, into our base camp. Our base camp, called “The Golf Course” at <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_24">An Khe</placeName>, was being hacked out of the jungle at that time and we had a forward party of a few, an officer and a few people, that had been cutting out some of the jungle where we were going to put in our battalion. It was in a sector that we would be on—our perimeter but we would be able to control artillery fires over about a third of the area there. That area was—we did not secure it the first night. It was secured by the <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_15">101st Air Borne</orgName>, who had a brigade there securing our perimeters, letting us get into place. All night long they were firing, and it was (Interviewee makes gun noises), it was an exciting night I should say, because it started to rain. They had pitched some tents and as I recall, we had cots and we were laying up on cots, and I was laying on a cot with some water dripping on my head and I kept saying, “This is the stupidest thing I’ve ever done in my life with all these guns going around, some of that.” But there were no bullets going through the tent, I can tell that because I’ve heard that sound and I though you know, this is war? This is terrible! Anyway, we made it through the night, and we took control over the perimeter and once the division took over control of the perimeter it was the same thing. Everybody was shooting at shadows, bushes and stuff until <persName ref="#ttu_466_person_6">General Kinnard</persName> sent down a—it may have been <persName ref="#ttu_466_person_7">Colonel Moore</persName> at the time, but I don’t remember. Anyway, word came down that when you shot one of the enemy out there, you would crawl out and drag him back. Well there wasn’t much shooting that night or any other night for that point on. Nobody wanted to crawl out there and pull somebody back. That’s a funny part of the story but that was real life.</u>
      <u who="NAPOLI">What was it like physically? What was the climate like for you? Awful? Comfortable?</u>
      <u who="LANGFORD">I grew up in the south, so I was familiar with hot weather. It’s hot and very humid. I found that the big problem was that there was never enough water to seem to get showers often enough, because you sweat it all the time. Our uniforms were not of a desert type, they were the old green uniforms of that time and they were very hot. So I found that part uncomfortable. It was one of those type things that you always want to take your helmet off and wipe the sweat off your brow and that sort of stuff. You know, it was something that you adjusted to that rather quickly. Then it got rather chilly at night and when you went into <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_25">Pleiku</placeName>, the <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_26">Ia Drang Valley</placeName>, places like that, you had to sleep in a sleeping bag at night. It got so cold you had you sleep in a mountain-type sleeping bag.</u>
      <u who="NAPOLI">This is <date when="1965-09">September of 1965</date>, right?</u>
      <u who="LANGFORD">Right. We landed in <date when="1965-09">September</date>; we did some operations that was known as the <name type="event" ref="#ttu_466_event_1">“Bong Son Plain”</name>, which later became a hot bed for fighting for many years. That was kind of what we called a “Shake out”. When we made our first air assault, we went up a Valley as I recall, called <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_27">Happy Valley</placeName>. As we made that assault up there, the artillery went in, we always landed the artillery first. We landed normally infantry company or something like that or platoon to secure LZ (Landing Zone) so that the artillery could come in with a non-hot LZ because Chinooks are very capable of being shot down easily. We went in and landed out in a sandy plain. Set the guns up, set up for fire missions and I had told all of my fire direction center people all the people in the S3 shop to start digging holes. They started digging some fox holes, leaning on the shovels, talking and all that until probably a <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_16">Viet Cong</orgName> fired, I believe rifles at us and one round went way over behind us and another round went short of us and they were artillerymen so they all realized that was a bracket. That was the wrong place, so they started digging very quickly. Some were on the ground very shortly after that. It was recall rifles, nothing followed that. But we did get the fire during that period of time. I personally, as a fire direction officer, learned a very important lesson on that mission and that was I should fire orders for all the artillery fire. If I didn’t issue the fire order, then nothing happened. I had this call from a forward observer, an air forward observer, that had found a battalion of enemy, <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_17">Viet Cong</orgName> as he identified them, marching or running, jogging down a road towards our infantry positions. Of course, he wanted infantry fire. I issued a fire command for battalion six volleys. Which would’ve been an awful lot of artillery fire. Before the mission was ready, I issued a—at my command so they wouldn’t fire. I went to ask the observer a lot of questions because I’d never seen many enemy that got out and exposed themselves like that unless they were really assaulting and they weren’t close enough to be assaulting. So I questioned him real hard, told him finally to fly down right close to him and see if he drew fire. If he didn’t draw fire, something was wrong. It turns out it was <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_18">ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam)</orgName> airborne troops and they had on black uniforms, that was their uniform. I learned right then that fire orders are dangerous if you don’t think long and hard through who you’re shooting, when you’re shooting and so forth. But I came very, very close to making a terrible mistake that sounded logical with everything but was not logically at all.</u>
      <u who="NAPOLI">Were you supported from higher up in your choice or did you get resistance from this?</u>
      <u who="LANGFORD">No, at that time we didn’t even have an S3, a captain substituted for the S3 because we had lost our S3. Our S3 back at Fort Benning, super officer, got promoted to lieutenant colonel and went to a command position. They shipped us in an airborne reject, I guess I’ll call him temporarily, a major who had a broken leg from airborne training, so he didn’t qualify to go to the <orgName ref="#ttu_466_org_19">airborne brigade of the 11th Air Assault</orgName>. So he was with us. When we arrived in country, after three or four days, they shipped him out to one of the headquarters and we had a vacancy for a while and some captain would fill in for that and they would go to the meetings and get the information back to me. We went like that for probably about a month or so. But we did have major in before we went into the <placeName ref="#ttu_466_place_28">Ia Drang Valley</placeName>.</u>
      <u who="NAPOLI">That takes us really through into <date when="1965-10">October of 1965</date>, right? The night missions, you’re running these shake out missions.</u>
      <u who="LANGFORD">Yes. Right. There's another part about the shake out that’s important to the artillery side of the house. We were now a unit that was familiar with shooting a certain direction of fire. But we had trained to fire three-hundred-and-sixty degrees which complicates artillery on the old piece artillery guns and so forth, citing devices very much, you had to know whether—</u>
